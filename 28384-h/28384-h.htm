<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The rambling personal notes threaded together in these
pages were written at the urgent request of my family,
and have provided a pleasant diversion during otherwise
lonely hours. The idea of their publication was highly distasteful
to me until the often repeated importunities of
many of those whose judgment commands my respect persuaded
me that some of the facts and incidents I have
recalled would prove of interest to a large circle of readers.
The narrative is concerned with persons and events that
have interested me during the busy hours of a lengthy life.
I have been deeply impressed by the changes wrought by
time in the modes of education, which are now so much at
variance with those of my childhood, and in the manners
and customs of those with whom I have mingled.</p>

<p>I should be guilty of an act of grave injustice if I
failed to express my grateful acknowledgments for the aid
so unselfishly rendered, in a score of ways, by my daughter,
Mrs. Roswell Randall Hoes, without which these pages
would not, and could not, have been written.</p>

<h2>AS I REMEMBER</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>EARLY LONG ISLAND DAYS</h3>


<p>I do not know of a spot where, had I been accorded the
selection, I should have preferred first to see the light
of day, nor one more in keeping with the promptings
of sentiment, than the southern shore of Long Island,
N.Y., where I was born. My home was in Queens
County, on the old Rockaway Road, and often in childhood
during storms at sea I have heard the waves dash
upon the Rockaway beach. Two miles the other side of
us was the village of Jamaica, and from our windows we
caught glimpses of the bay that bore its name. My first
home was a large old-fashioned house on a farm of many
acres, ornamented by Lombardy poplars which stood on
each side of the driveway, a fashion introduced into this
country by Lafayette. My maternal grandfather, Captain
John Hazard, who had commanded a privateersman
during the Revolution, purchased the place from "Citizen"
Edmond Charles Genet, the first Minister of France
to the United States, and I have the old parchment deed
of transfer still in my possession. During the War of
the Revolution my Grandfather Hazard's ship was captured
by Admiral George B. Rodney, and I have often
heard my mother tell the story she received from his lips,
to the effect that after he was "comfortably housed in
irons" on Rodney's ship he overheard a conversation in
which his name was frequently mentioned. The subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
under discussion was the form of punishment he deserved,
and the cheerful remark reached his ear: "Hang the
damned rebel." This incident made an indelible impression
upon my mother's memory, which was emphasized
by the fact that her father bore the scars of those
irons to the day of his death.</p>

<p>I have no recollection of my Grandfather Hazard, as
he died soon after my birth. Jonathan Hazard, his
brother, espoused the English cause during the Revolution.
This was possibly due to the influences of an English
mother, whose maiden name was Sarah Owen, of Shropshire.
I have heard my mother say that her grandmother
was a descendant of Dr. John Owen, Chaplain of Oliver
Cromwell. A piece of silver bearing the Owen coat of
arms is still in the possession of a member of my family.
He entered the British navy, changed his name to
Carr, and soon rose to the rank of Post-Captain. He
eventually drifted back to America and died unmarried
at my grandfather's home on Long Island many years
after the war. The trite saying that history repeats itself
is here forcibly illustrated by brother fighting
against brother. It brings to mind our own fraternal
troubles during the Civil War, which can never be effaced
from memory.</p>

<p>Much of the furniture of my first home was purchased
from Citizen Genet when my grandfather took possession
of the house and farm. We understood that the French
minister brought it with him from France, and many of
the pieces, some of which are mahogany, are still in my
possession. A bedstead which I still occupy has been
said to be the first of its design brought from France to
this country. Hanging in my bedroom is a set of engravings
entitled "Diligence and Dissipation," after Hogarth,
and also a handsome old print of the Savior in
the Pharisee's House, all of which were purchased at the
same time. Two alabaster ornaments are memories of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
earliest childhood, one of which was a column casting a
shadow that formed a likeness of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>My Grandfather Hazard had many slaves, and I remember
hearing of one of them who ran away and took with
him a carriage and pair of horses, and, who, when called
to account for the act, threatened my grandfather's
life. My mother, although suffering from a severe indisposition,
ran out of the house for succor. The slave was
taken into custody, and was eventually sent South and
sold. Some of the other slaves I well remember. Among
them was a very old couple with numerous progeny who
lived not far from us in a hut in the woods on the Hazard
estate. In subsequent years I heard my mother remark,
upon the occasion of a marriage in the family connection,
that when "Cuff" and "Sary" were married her father
gave the clergyman five dollars for his services. Cuff was
an old-fashioned, festive negro born in this country, and
with the firm belief that existence was bestowed upon him
solely for his own enjoyment. He possessed a genius for
discovering holidays, and added many to the calendar that
were new to most of us. For example, sometimes when
he was given a task to accomplish, he would announce
that he could not work upon that day as it was "Paas
Monday," or "Paas Tuesday," and so on, continuing as
the case required, through the week. He had supreme
contempt for what he called "Guinea niggers," a term
he applied to those of his race who came directly from
Africa, in contradistinction to those who had been born
in this country. One of Cuff's predecessors in the Hazard
family was named Ben, and I have the original deed
of his purchase from Hendrick Suydam, dated April 28th,
1807. The price paid was two hundred dollars.</p>

<p>In the village of Jamaica was a well known academy
where my mother received the early part of her education.
One of her preceptors there was the Hon. Luther
Bradish, who some years later became Lieutenant Gover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>nor
of the State of New York, and who at the time of his
death was president of the New York Historical Society.
Her education was continued at Miss Sarah Pierce's
school in Litchfield, Connecticut, one of the most fashionable
educational institutions of that period. I have
heard my mother say that, accompanied by her father,
she made the journey to Litchfield in a chariot, the name
applied to carriages in those days, this, of course, being
before there was any rail communication with that place.
In close proximity to Miss Pierce's establishment was the
law school of Judge James Gould, whose pupils were a
great social resource to Miss Pierce's scholars. This institution
was patronized by many pupils from the South,
and during my mother's time John C. Calhoun was one
of its students. A few years ago a history of the school
was published, and a copy of the book was loaned me by
the late Mrs. Lucius Tuckerman of Washington, whose
mother was educated there and whose grandfather was
the celebrated Oliver Wolcott of Connecticut. After my
mother's marriage, she and my father visited Miss Pierce
in Litchfield. This was during the Jackson campaign,
while political excitement ran so very high that a prominent
physician of the place remarked to my father, in perfectly
good faith, that Jackson could not possibly be
elected President as he would receive no support from
Litchfield.</p>

<p>In Jamaica was the last residence of the Honorable
Rufus King, our minister to England under Washington
and twenty years later a candidate for the presidency.
His son, Charles King, was the beloved President of Columbia
College in New York, and his few surviving students
hold his memory in reverence. The house in which
the King family resided was a stately structure with an
<i>entourage</i> of fine old trees. It eventually passed into
other hands, and a few years ago the entire property was
generously donated by the Daughters of the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Revolution to the town of Jamaica, and is now called
"King's Manor."</p>

<p>My grandfather, Captain John Hazard, was about fifty
years old at the time of his marriage to my grandmother,
Miss Leupp, of New Jersey, who died soon after, leaving
an only child, my mother. A few years later he married
Lydia Blackwell at her home on Blackwell's Island, which
her father, Jacob Blackwell, had inherited from his father,
Jacob Blackwell, the son of Robert Blackwell, who was
the progenitor of the family in this country and gave his
name to the island upon which he resided. Several years
later Captain Hazard was heard to remark that matrimony
was a lottery, and that he had drawn two prizes.
I have in my possession an old letter written by Miss
Blackwell to my grandfather previous to their marriage,
which is so quaint and formal that I am tempted to give
it in full:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Miss Blackwell's compliments to Captain Hazard and
desires to know how he does&mdash;and if well enough will be
glad to see him the first leisure day&mdash;as she has something
of consequence to communicate and is sorry to hear
that he has been so much indisposed as to deprive his
friends of the pleasure of his company for this last fortnight&mdash;May
you enjoy every happiness this imperfect estate
affords is the sincere wish of your friend,</p>

<p class='right'>L. B.</p>

<p>Let me see you on Sunday.</p>

<p>Burn this.</p></div>

<p>Captain Hazard brought his new bride to the old home
on the Rockaway Road where I was subsequently born,
and she immediately took under her protecting wing my
mother, who was then but little more than an infant.
The babe grew and thrived, and never knew until she was
a good-sized girl that the woman who had so lovingly nurtured
her was only a step-mother. She learned the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
from a schoolmate who told her out of revenge for some
fancied wrong; and I shall always remember my mother
telling me how she hurried home feeling all the time that
the cruel story was untrue, only to have it confirmed by
the lips of the woman who had been as affectionate and
unselfish as any mother could possibly have been to her
own child. In subsequent years, when my mother gathered
her own children around her, she held her step-mother
up to us as the embodiment of all female virtue and excellence,
all of which is confirmed by my own recollection
of her remarkable character and exemplary life.</p>

<p>On the farm adjoining us lived a crusty old bachelor by
the name of Martin, who in his earlier life had been professionally
associated with Aaron Burr. No human being
was allowed to cross his threshold, but I recall that years
after his death I saw a large quantity of silver which he
had inherited, and which bore a martin for a crest. He
was a terror to all the children in our vicinity, and it was
his habit to walk on the neighboring roads clad in a dressing
gown. More than once as I passed him he accosted
me with the interrogative, "Are you Nancy Hazard's
brat?"&mdash;a query that invariably prompted me to quicken
my pace. Mr. Martin kept a fine herd of cattle, among
which was an obstreperous bull whose stentorian tones
were familiar to all the residents of the adjoining places.
When the children of our household were turbulent my
mother would often exclaim, "Listen to Martin's bull roaring!"
This invariably had a soothing effect upon the
children, and strange to say this trivial incident has descended
among my kindred to the fourth generation, for
my mother's great-grandchildren are as familiar with
"Martin's bull" as my sisters and brothers and I were in
our own childhood.</p>

<p>Malcolm Campbell, my paternal grandfather, left Scotland
subsequently to our Revolution, accompanied by his
wife and son James (my father), and after a passage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
several weeks landed in New York. His wife was Miss
Lucy McClellan. His father, Alexander Campbell, fought
in the battle of Culloden, and I have heard my father say
that his grandfather's regiment marched to the song of:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who wadna fight for Charlie?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wadna draw the sword?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wadna up and rally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At their royal prince's word?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think on Scotia's ancient heroes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think on foreign foes repell'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think on glorious Bruce and Wallace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who the proud usurpers quell'd."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is said he had previously been sent to Italy to collect
arms and ammunition for the "Young Pretender," the
grandson of James II. The battle of Culloden, which
was fought on the 16th of April, 1746, and which has often
been called the "Culloden Massacre," caused the whole civilized
world to stand aghast. The order of the Duke of Cumberland
to grant no quarter to prisoners placed him foremost
in the ranks of "British beasts" that have disgraced
the pages of history, and earned for him the unenviable
title of "The Butcher of Culloden." It has been suggested
in extenuation of his fiendish conduct that His
Grace was "deep in his cups" the night before the battle,
and that the General to whom the order was given,
realizing the condition of the Duke, insisted that his instructions
should be reduced to writing. His Grace thereupon
angrily seized a playing card from the table where
he was engaged in gambling, and complied with the request.
This card happened to be the nine of diamonds,
and to this day is known as "the curse of Scotland." A
long period elapsed before those who had sympathized
with the Young Pretender's cause were restored to the
good graces of the English throne, and it was Scotland
that was compelled to bear the brunt of the royal dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>pleasure.
The sins of the fathers were visited upon their
children, and it is not at all unlikely that the sympathies
of Alexander Campbell's son, Malcolm (my grandfather),
for the last of the House of Stuart developed a chain of
circumstances that resulted, with other causes, in his embarkation
for America.</p>

<p>During the early period of my childhood I became familiar
with the Jacobite songs which my father used to
sing, and which had been handed down in the Campbell
family. I was so deeply imbued during my early life with
the Jacobite spirit of my forefathers that when I read the
account in my English history of George I, carrying with
him his little dissolute Hanoverian Court and crossing the
water to England to become King of Great Britain, I felt
even at that late day that the act was a personal grievance.
Through the passage of many years a fragment of one of
these Jacobite songs still rings in my ears:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There's nae luck aboot the hoose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's nae luck ava [at all];<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's little pleasure in the hoose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When our gude man's awa."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even now some of those songs appeal to me possibly in
the same manner as the "Marseillaise" to the French, or
the "Ranz de Vaches" to the Swiss who have wandered
from their mountain homes, or as the strains of our
national hymn affect my own fellow countrymen in foreign
lands, whose hearts are made to throb when with uncovered
heads they listen, and are carried back in memory
to the days of "auld lang syne."</p>

<p>My grandfather, Malcolm Campbell, received the degree
of Master of Arts from the University of St. Andrews, the
great school of Scottish Latinity, and his diploma conferring
upon him that honor is still in the possession of his
descendants. Before leaving Scotland he had formed an
intimacy with Andrew Picken, and during the voyage to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
America enjoyed the pleasing companionship of that gentleman
together with his wife and their two children.
Mrs. Picken was the only daughter of Sir Charles Burdette
of London, whose wife was the daughter of the Earl
of Wyndham. She and Andrew Picken, who was a native
of Stewarton, in Ayrshire, a younger branch of a noble
family, four years previously had made a clandestine marriage
and, after vainly attempting to effect a reconciliation
with her father, resolved upon emigrating to America.
Their daughter, Mrs. Sara Jane Picken Cohen, widow of
the Rev. Dr. Abraham H. Cohen of Richmond, Virginia,
wrote the memoirs of her life, and in describing her parents'
voyage to this country says: "It was one of those
old-time voyages, of nine weeks and three days, from land
to land, and a very boisterous one it was. There had been
a terrific storm, which had raged violently for several
days." This friendship formed in the mother country
was naturally much strengthened during the long voyage,
and when the two families finally reached New York,
Mrs. Cohen writes: "Here we settled down our two families,
strangers in a strange land. But the lamp of friendship
burned brightly and lit us on the way; our children
grew up together in early childhood, and as brothers and
sisters were born in each family they were named in succession
after each other." It is pleasant to state that this
friendship formed so many generations ago is still continued
in my family, as my daughters and I frequently
enjoy in our Washington home the pleasing society of Mr.
and Mrs. Roberdeau Buchanan, the latter of whom is the
great granddaughter of Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Picken.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival in New York Malcolm Campbell
established a classical school at 85 Broadway nearly opposite
Trinity Church. He edited the first American edition
of Cicero's orations and of C&aelig;sar's commentaries,
and also revised and corrected and published in 1808
l'Abb&eacute; Tardy's French dictionary. His first edition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Cicero is dedicated to the "Right Reverend Benjamin
Moore, D.D., Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church
in the State of New York, and President of Columbia
College," and another edition with the same text and imprint
is dedicated, in several pages of Latin, to the learned
Samuel L. Mitchell, M.D. He and his wife were buried
in the graveyard of the Wall Street Presbyterian Church.
It may not be inappropriate in this connection to refer to
another instructor of an even earlier period which has
come within my notice, who taught reading, writing and
arithmetic "with becoming accuracy." In <i>The New
York Journal Or The General Advertiser</i> of the 30th of
April, 1772, appears the following advertisement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">The respectable Public</span> is hereby informed that,
agreeable to a former advertisement, a Seminary of Learning
was opened at New Brunswick, last November, by
the name of <i>Queen's College</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and also a Grammar School,
in order to prepare Youth for the same. Any Parents or
Guardians who may be inclined to send their Children to
this Institution, may depend upon having them instructed
with the greatest Care and Diligence in all the Arts and
Sciences usually taught in public Schools; the strictest
Regard will be paid to their moral Conduct, (and in a
word) to every Thing which may tend to render them a
Pleasure to their Friends, and an Ornament to their
Species.</p>

<p>Also to obviate the Objection of some to sending their
Children on Account of their small Proficiency in English,
a proper Person has been provided, who attends at
the Grammar School an Hour a Day, and teaches Reading,
Writing and Arithmetic with becoming Accuracy&mdash;It
is hoped that the above Considerations, together with
the healthy and convenient Situation of the Place, on a
Pleasant and navigable River, in the midst of a plentiful
Country; the Reasonableness of the Inhabitants in the
Price of Board, and the easy Access from all Places, either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
by Land or Water will be esteemed by the considerate
Public, as a sufficient Recommendation of this infant College,
which (as it is erected upon so Catholic a Plan) will
undoubtedly prove <i>advantageous</i> to our new American
World, by assisting its <span class="smcap">Sister Semminaries</span> to cultivate
Piety, Learning, and Liberty.</p>

<p class='indent1'><i>Per Order of the Trustees</i>,</p>

<p class='indent2'><span class="smcap">Frederick Frelinghuysen</span>, Tutor.</p>

<p>N.B. The Vacation of the College will be expired on
Wednesday the 6th of May, any Students then offering
themselves shall be admitted into such Class, as (upon
Examination) they shall be found capable of entering.</p></div>

<p>The signer of this interesting advertisement was graduated
from Princeton College in 1770, and subsequently
became a lawyer. His distinguished son, Theodore, was
widely known as a philanthropist and Christian statesman,
and at various periods was United States Senator, Chancellor
of the New York University, President of Rutgers
College, a candidate for the Vice Presidency of the United
States, and President of the American Bible Society. A
grandson of the signer was the Hon. Frederick Theodore
Frelinghuysen, the well remembered United States Senator
and Secretary of State under President Arthur.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Frelinghuysen family, I recall an amusing
story told at the expense of Newark, New Jersey.
When the late Secretary Frelinghuysen presented himself
at the gates of Heaven he was surprised not to be recognized
by St. Peter, who asked him who he was. "I am
the Hon. Frederick T. Frelinghuysen," was the response.
"From where?" "Newark, New Jersey."
"Newark?" quoth St. Peter, "I never heard of that place,
but I will look on my list. No, it isn't there. I can not
admit you, Mr. Frelinghuysen." So the old gentleman
proceeded and knocked at another gate in the boundless
immensity. The devil opened it and looked out. The
same conversation occurred as with St. Peter. Newark
wasn't "on the list." "My Heavens, Mr. Satan, am I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
then doomed to return to Newark?" exclaimed the New
Jersey statesman, and went back to the Newark graveyard.</p>

<p>My father, James Campbell, was born in Callander,
Scotland, and, as I have before stated, came to this country
with his parents as a very young child. Both he and
his father were clad in their Highland dress upon their
arrival in New York. His childhood was spent in the
great metropolis, and he subsequently studied law in Albany,
with the Hon. Samuel Miles Hopkins, the grandfather
of Mrs. Arent Schuyler Crowninshield. He was
admitted to the bar, and almost immediately became a
Master in Chancery. In 1821 he was appointed Surrogate
of New York, a position which he retained for twenty
years. He was always a pronounced democrat, but notwithstanding
this fact he was reappointed ten successive
times. In 1840, however, the Whig party was in the
ascendency in the New York Legislature, and through the
instrumentality of William H. Seward, who introduced a
system called "pipe laying," the whole political atmosphere
was changed. "Pipe laying" was an organized
scheme for controlling votes, and derived its name from
certain political manipulations connected with the introduction
of Croton water in New York City. I have
learned in later years that more approved methods are
frequently used for controlling votes. Modern ethics has
discovered a more satisfactory method through means of
powerful corporations with coffers wide open in the holy
cause of electing candidates.</p>

<p>This unfortunate state of affairs resulted in the removal
of my father from office, and he immediately resumed the
practice of law. Some of his decisions as Surrogate are
regarded as precedents to this day. Two of the most
prominent of these are "Watts and LeRoy vs. Public Administrator"
(a decision resulting in the establishment
of the Leake and Watts Orphan House) and "In the
matter of the last Will and Testament of Alice Lis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>penard,
deceased." He is said to have owned about this
time the largest private library in New York City, composed
largely of foreign imprints, as he seemed to have but
little regard for American editions. The classical portion
of his library, especially the volumes published in Paris,
was regarded as unusually choice and well selected. He
had also a large collection of Greek Testaments which he
read in preference to the translations. He owned a copy
of Didot's Virgil and I have always understood that, with
the exception of one owned in the Brevoort family of New
York, it was at that time the only copy in America. He
retained his scholarly tastes throughout his whole life, and
in looking back I delight to picture him as seated in his
library surrounded by his beloved books. In 1850, about
two years after his death, his library was sold at auction,
the catalogue of which covers 114 closely printed pages.
Among the purchasers were William E. Burton, the actor,
Chief Justice Charles P. Daly and Henry W. Longfellow.</p>

<p>Professor Charles Anthon of Columbia College dedicated
his Horace to my father in the following choice
words:</p>

<p class='center'>
To<br />
My old &amp; valued friend<br />
James Campbell, Esq.,<br />
who, amid the graver duties of a judicial station,<br />
can still find leisure to gratify a pure and<br />
cultivated taste, by reviving the<br />
studies of earlier years.<br />
</p>

<p>The following letter from Professor Anthon, the original
of which is still retained by the family, was addressed
to my mother shortly after my father's death.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Col[umbia] Coll[ege]</span>, Sep. 3d 1849.</p>

<p>Dear Madam,</p>

<p>I dedicated the accompanying work to your lamented
husband in happier years, while he was still in the full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
career of honourable usefulness; and, now that death has
taken him from us, I deem it but right that the volume
which bore his name while living, should still continue to
be a memento of him. May I request you to accept this
humble but sincere tribute to the memory of a most valued
friend?</p>

<p class='indent3'>I remain, very respectfully and truly,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">Chas. Anthon.</span></p>

<p>
Mrs. Campbell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houston Street.</p>
</div>

<p>When Professor Anthon was about forty-eight years of
age Edgar Allan Poe described him as "about five feet,
eight inches in height; rather stout; fair complexion; hair
light and inclined to curl; forehead remarkably broad and
high; eye gray, clear, and penetrating; mouth well-formed,
with excellent teeth&mdash;the lips having great flexibility, and
consequent power of expression; the smile particularly
pleasing. His address in general is bold, frank, cordial,
full of <i>bonhomie</i>. His whole air is <i>distingu&eacute;</i> in the best
understanding of the term&mdash;that is to say, he would impress
anyone at first sight with the idea of his being no
ordinary man. He has qualities, indeed, which would
have assured him eminent success in almost any pursuit;
and there are times in which his friends are half disposed
to regret his exclusive devotion to classical literature."</p>

<p>My father was a trustee of the venerable New York
Society Library and one of the directors of the old United
States Bank in Philadelphia; and I have in my possession
a number of interesting letters from Nicholas Biddle, its
president, addressed to him and asking his advice and
counsel. For eighteen years he was a trustee of Columbia
College in New York, and enjoyed the close friendship of
President William A. Duer, Reverend and Professor John
McVickar, James Renwick, Professor of Chemistry, whose
mother, Jennie Jeffery, was Burns's "Blue-e'ed Lassie,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and Professor Charles Anthon, all of whom filled chairs
in that institution with unquestioned ability. My father
was also a member of the St. Andrews Society of New
York. After his death, President Duer in an impressive
address alluded to him in the following manner:</p>

<p>"Two of our associates with whom I have been similarly
connected and have known from boyhood have also departed,
leaving sweet memories behind them, James Campbell
and David S. Jones, the former a scholar and a ripe
and good one, once honoring the choice of his fellow citizens
and winning golden opinions as Surrogate of this
city and county."</p>

<p>President Duer had a most interesting family of children.
His eldest married daughter, Frances Maria, was
the wife of Henry Shaeffe Hoyt of Park Place, and died
recently in Newport at a very advanced age. Eleanor
Jones Duer, another daughter, married George T. Wilson,
an Englishman. She was a great beauty, bearing a striking
resemblance to Fanny Kemble, and was remarkable
for her strong intellect. Her marriage was clandestine,
and the cause, as far as I know, was never explained.
Still another daughter, Elizabeth, married Archibald
Gracie King of Weehawken, and was a Colonial Dame of
much prominence in her later years. She was the mother
of the authoress, Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer. President
Duer's wife was Hannah Maria Denning of Fishkill,
New York. I knew her only as an elderly woman possessing
a fine presence and social tastes.</p>

<p>In my early life the students of Columbia College enjoyed
playing practical jokes upon its dignified professors.
As an illustration, I remember once seeing the death of
Professor Renwick fictitiously published in one of the
daily journals, much to the sorrow and subsequently the
indignation of a large circle of friends. Professor Anthon,
too, although a confirmed bachelor, had to face his
turn, and his marriage to some unknown bride bearing an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
assumed name was an occasional announcement. But the
most amusing feature of the joke would appear in the
morning, when an emphatic denial would be seen in the
columns of the same newspaper, accompanied by a quotation
in spurious Latin. Professor Anthon lived with his
two spinster sisters in one of the college buildings, and
their home was a rendezvous for an appreciative younger
generation. In connection with his duties at the college,
he was the head of the Columbia College Grammar School,
and I have always understood that he strictly followed the
scriptural injunction not "to spare the rod." His victims
were repeatedly heard to remark that these flagellations
partially counterbalanced the lack of exercise which
he felt very keenly in his sedentary life. But with all his
austerity his pupils would occasionally be astonished over
the amount of humor that he was capable of displaying.
His handwriting was exquisitely minute in character, and
I have in my possession two valentines composed by him
and sent to me which are quaintly beautiful in language
and, although sixty years old, are still in a perfect state
of preservation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8"><i>To Miss Marian Campbell.</i><br /></span>

<p class='indent4'>(Written a few years later.)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweet girl! within whose laughing eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand little Cupids lie,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>John Louis Tellkampf, to whom Anthon so facetiously
alludes in the second valentine, was a young German who
frequently came to our house, and who, through my father's
aid and influence, in subsequent years became professor
of German in Columbia College. When we first
knew him he spoke English with much difficulty, and it
was a standing joke in our household that once when he
desired to say that a certain person had been born he expressed
the fact as "getting alive."</p>

<p>Malcolm Campbell, a younger brother of mine, was
graduated in 1850 from Columbia College near the head
of his class. Among his classmates were Charles Seymour,
subsequently Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal
Church of Illinois, and the distinguished lawyer Frederick
R. Coudert, whose father kept a boys' French school in
Bleecker Street. My brother subsequently studied law in
the office of Judge Henry Hilton, and for many years
practiced at the New York bar. Upon a certain occasion
he and Samuel F. Kneeland were opposing counsel in an
important suit during which Mr. Kneeland kept quoting
from his own work upon "Mechanics' Liens." My brother
endured this as long as his patience permitted and then,
slowly rising to his feet, said: "I have cited decisions on
the point in controversy, but my learned opponent cites
nothing except his own opinions printed in his own book.
With such persistency has he done this that I have been
tempted to write these lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, Kneeland! dear Kneeland, pray what do you mean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By such a fat book on the subject of Lien?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it for glory or was it for pelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or just for the pleasure of quoting yourself?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></div></div>

<p>It seems almost needless to add that this doggerel was
followed by a round of applause, and that Chief Justice
Charles P. Daly and Judge Joseph F. Daly, as well as
Judge George M. Van Hoesen, who were on the bench at
this time, joined in the merriment.</p>

<p>The commencement exercises of Columbia College, as I
remember them, took place every summer in St. John's
Church opposite St. John's Park, and I often attended
them in my early days. Columbia College at this period
was in the lower part of the city between College and Park
Places, and was the original King's College of colonial
days. All of the professors lived in the college buildings
in a most unostentatious manner, and I readily recall frequent
instances during my early childhood when, in company
with my father, I walked to the college and took a
simple six o'clock supper with Professor Anthon and his
sisters.</p>

<p>My mother met my father while visiting in New York,
and the acquaintance eventually resulted in a runaway
marriage. They were married on the 10th of June, 1818,
and nine days later the following notice appeared in <i>The
National Advocate</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><i>Married.</i></p>

<p>At Flushing, L.I., by the Rev. Mr. [Barzilla] Buckley,
James Campbell esq. of this city, to Miss Mary Ann Hazard,
daughter of John Hazard, esq. of Jamaica, Long
Island.</p></div>

<p>The objection of my Grandfather Hazard to my mother's
marriage was not unnatural, as she was his only child,
and being at this time well advanced in years he dreaded
the separation. But the happy bride immediately brought
her husband to live in the old home where she had been
born, where the young couple began their married life
under pleasing auspices, and my father continued his
practice of law in New York. I had the misfortune of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
being a second daughter. Traditionally, I know that my
grandfather most earnestly desired a grandson at that
time, and when the nurse announced my birth, she was
not sufficiently courageous to tell the truth, and said: "A
boy, sir!" Her faltering manner possibly betrayed her,
as the sarcastic retort was: "I dare say, an Irish boy."</p>

<p>My ambitious parents sent me with my oldest sister,
Fanny, at the early age of four, to a school in the village
of Jamaica conducted by Miss Delia Bacon. My recollection
of events occurring at this early period is not very
vivid, but I still recall the vision of three beautiful women,
Delia, Alice and Julia Bacon, who presided over our
school. This interesting trio were nieces of the distinguished
author and divine, the Rev. Dr. Leonard Bacon,
who for fifty-seven years was pastor of the First Congregational
Church of New Haven. Many years subsequent
to my school days, Delia Bacon became, as is well known,
an enthusiastic advocate of the Baconian authorship of
Shakespeare's plays. I have understood that she made a
pilgrimage to Stratford-on-Avon hoping to secure the
proper authority to reopen Shakespeare's grave, a desire,
however, that remained ungratified. She was a woman of
remarkable ability, and I have in my possession the book,
written by her nephew, which tells the story of her life.
I was Miss Bacon's youngest pupil, and attended school
regularly in company with my sister, whither we were
driven each morning in the family carriage. My studies
were not difficult, and my principal recollection is my
playing out of doors with a dog named Sancho, while the
older children were busy inside with their studies.</p>

<p>During my Long Island life, as a very young child, I
was visiting my aunts in Jay Street, New York, when I
was taken to Grant Thorburn's seed shop in Maiden Lane,
which I think was called "The Arcade." There was much
there to delight the childish fancy&mdash;canaries, parrots, and
other birds of varied plumage. Thorburn's career was de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>cidedly
unusual. He was born in Scotland, where he
worked in his father's shop as a nailmaker. He came to
New York in 1794 and for a time continued at his old
trade. He then kept a seed store and, after making quite
a fortune, launched into a literary career and wrote under
the <i>nom de plume</i> of "Laurie Todd."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>NEW YORK AND SOME NEW YORKERS</h3>


<p>About 1828 my parents moved to New York, and
immediately occupied the house, No. 6 Hubert
Street, purchased by my father, and pleasantly located
a short distance from St. John's Park, then the fashionable
section of the city. This park was always kept
locked, but it was the common play-ground of the children
of the neighborhood, whose families were furnished
with keys, as is the case with Gramercy Park to-day. St.
John's Church overlooked this park, and the houses on the
other three sides of the square were among the finest residences
in the city. Many of them were occupied by families
of prominence, among which were those of Watts,
Gibbes, Kemble, Hamilton and Smedberg. Next door to
us on Hubert Street lived Commander, subsequently Rear
Admiral, Charles Wilkes, U.S.N., and his young family.
His first wife was Miss Jane Jeffrey Renwick, who was a
sister of Professor James Renwick of Columbia College,
and after her death he married Mary Lynch, a daughter
of Henry Lynch of New York and the widow of Captain
William Compton Bolton of the Navy. This, of
course, was previous to his naval achievements, which are
such well known events in American history. In after
life Admiral and Mrs. Wilkes moved to Washington,
D.C., where I renewed my friendship of early days and
where members of his family still reside, beloved and respected
by the whole community.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas S. Gibbes of South Carolina, whose wife
was Miss Susan Annette Vanden Heuvel, daughter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
John C. Vanden Heuvel, a wealthy land owner, lived on
Hudson Street, facing St. John's Park. Their elder
daughter Charlotte Augusta, who married John Jacob
Astor, son of William B. Astor, was an early playmate
of mine, and many pleasant memories of her as a little
girl cluster around St. John's Park, where we romped
together. When I first knew the Gibbes family it had
recently returned from a long residence in Paris, an
unusual experience in these days, and both Charlotte Augusta
and her younger sister, Annette Gibbes, sang in a
very pleasing manner French songs, which were a decided
novelty to our juvenile ears. Mrs. Gibbes's sisters were
Mrs. Gouverneur S. Bibby and Mrs. John C. Hamilton.</p>

<p>Directly opposite St. John's Park, on the corner of
Varick and Beach streets, was Miss Maria Forbes's school
for young girls, which was the fashionable school of the
day. I attended it in company with my sister Fanny and
my brother James who was my junior. Miss Forbes occasionally
admitted boys to her school when accompanied
by older sisters. Our life there was regulated in accordance
with the strictest principles of learning and etiquette,
and a child would have been deficient indeed who failed
to acquire knowledge under the tuition of such an able
teacher. School commenced promptly at eight o'clock and
continued without intermission until three.</p>

<p>The principal of the school was the daughter of John
Forbes, who for thirty years was the librarian of the New
York Society Library. He was a native of Aberdeen in
Scotland, and was brought to this country in extreme
youth by a widowed mother of marked determination and
piety, with the intention of launching him successfully in
life. He early displayed a fondness for books, and must
have shown an uncommon maturity of mind and much
executive ability, as he was only nineteen when he was
appointed to the position just named. It is an interesting
fact that he accepted the librarianship in 1798 with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
salary of two hundred and fifty dollars a year in addition
to the fines and two and a half per cent. upon all moneys
collected, besides the use or rental of the lower front room
of the library building. After many years of labor his
salary was raised to five hundred dollars. Upon his
death in October, 1824, the trustees, out of respect to his
memory, voted to attend his funeral in a body and ordered
the library closed for the remaining four days of the week.
He married Miss Martha Skidmore, daughter of Lemuel
Skidmore, a prominent iron and steel merchant of New
York, and I have no doubt that Maria Forbes, their daughter
and my early teacher, inherited her scholarly tastes
from her father, of whom Dr. John W. Francis in his
"Old New York" justly speaks as a "learned man."</p>

<p>Miss Forbes was a pronounced disciplinarian, and administered
one form of punishment which left a lasting
impression upon my memory. For certain trivial offenses
a child was placed in a darkened room and clothed in a
tow apron. One day I was subjected to this punishment
for many hours, an incident which naturally I have never
yet been able to forget. On the occasion referred to
Miss Forbes was obliged to leave the schoolroom for a
few minutes and, unfortunately for my happiness, appointed
my young brother James to act as monitor during
her absence. His first experience in the exercise of a
little authority evidently turned his head, for upon the
return of our teacher I was reported for misbehavior.
The charge against me was that I had smiled. It is too
long ago to remember whether or not it was a smile of derision,
but upon mature reflection I think it must have
been. I knew, however, in my childish heart that I had
committed no serious offense and, as can readily be imagined,
my indignation was boundless. It was the first act
of injustice I had ever experienced. Feeling that the
punishment was undeserved, and smarting under it, with
abundance of leisure upon my hands, I bit the tough tow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
apron into many pieces. When Miss Forbes after a few
hours, which seemed to me an eternity, came to relieve me
from my irksome position and noticed the condition of the
apron, she regaled me with a homily upon the evils of bad
temper, and gave as practical illustrations the lives of
some of our most noted criminals, all of whom had expiated
their crimes upon the gallows.</p>

<p>In recalling these early school days it seems to me that
the rudiments of education received far more attention
then than now. Spelling was regarded as of chief importance
and due consideration was given to grammar.
There were no "frills" then, such as physical culture,
manual training and the like, and vacation lasted but
thirty days, usually during the month of August. Some
of my earliest friendships were formed at Miss Forbes's
school, many of which I have retained through a long life.
Among my companions and classmates were the Tillotsons,
Lynches, Astors, Kembles, Hamiltons, Duers, and
Livingstons.</p>

<p>But in spite of the severe discipline of Miss Forbes's
school, her pupils occasionally engaged in current gossip.
It was in her schoolroom I first made the discovery that
this earth boasted of such valuable adjuncts to the human
family as title-bearing gentlemen, and in this particular
case it was a live Count that was brought to my notice.
Count Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro had recently arrived in
New York, and his engagement to Adelaide Lynch, a
daughter of Judge James Lynch, of an old New York
family, was soon announced. On the voyage to America
he had made the acquaintance of a son of Lord Henry
Gage of England, whose principal object in visiting this
country was to make the acquaintance of his kinsman, Mr.
Gouverneur Kemble. Through his instrumentality Tasistro
was introduced into New York's most exclusive set, and
soon became the lion of the hour. We girls discussed the
engagement and subsequent marriage of the distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
foreigner (<i>sub rosa</i>, of course), and to our childish vision
pictured a wonderful career for this New York girl. The
marriage, however, soon terminated unfortunately, and to
the day of his death Tasistro's origin remained a mystery.
He was an intellectual man of fine presence and skilled in
a number of foreign languages. He claimed he was a
graduate of Dublin College. Many years later, after I
had become more familiar with title-bearing foreigners,
Tasistro again crossed my path in Washington, where he
was acting as a translator in the State Department; but
after a few years, owing to an affection of the eyes, he was
obliged to give up this position, and his condition was one
of destitution. Through the instrumentality of my husband
he obtained an annuity from his son, whom, by the
way, he never knew; and for some years, in a spirit of
gratitude, taught my children French. His last literary
effort was the translation of the first two volumes of the
Comte de Paris's "History of the Civil War in America."
His devotion to my husband was pathetic, and I have frequently
heard the Count say during the last years of his
life that he never met him without some good fortune immediately
following.</p>

<p>After Mr. Gouverneur's death I received the following
letter from Tasistro, which is so beautiful in diction that
I take pleasure in inserting it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, April 26, 1880.</p>

<p>My dear Mrs. Gouverneur,</p>

<p>Had I obeyed implicitly the impulses of my heart, or
been less deeply affected by the great loss which will ever
render the 5th of April a day of sad &amp; bitter memories
to me, I should perhaps have been more expeditious in
rendering to you the poor tribute of my condolence for
the terrible bereavement which it has pleased the Supreme
Ruler of all things to afflict you with.</p>

<p>My own particular grief in thus losing the best &amp; most
valued friend I ever had on earth, receives additional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
poignancy from the fact that, although duly impressed
with an abiding sense of the imperishable obligation, conferred
upon me by my lamented friend, I have been debarred,
by my own physical infirmities, from proffering
those services which it would have afforded me so much
consolation to perform.</p>

<p>I should be loath, however, to start on my own journey
for that shadowy land whose dim outlines are becoming
daily more &amp; more visible to my mental eye, without
leaving some kind of record attesting to the depth of my
appreciation of all the noble attributes which clustered
around your husband's character&mdash;of my intense &amp;
lasting gratitude for his generous exertions in my behalf,
&amp; my profound sympathy for you personally in this hour
of sorrow &amp; affliction.</p>

<p>Hoping that you may find strength adequate to the
emergency, I remain, with great respect,</p>

<p class='indent3'>Your devoted servant,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">L. F. Tasistro.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A valued friend of my father's was Dr. John W. Francis,
the "Doctor Sangrado" of this period, who, with other
practitioners of the day, believed in curing all maladies
by copious bleeding and a dose of calomel. He was the
fashionable physician of that time and especially prided
himself upon his physical resemblance to Benjamin Franklin.
He had much dramatic ability of a comic sort, and
I have often heard the opinion expressed that if he had
adopted the stage as a profession he would have rivalled
the comedian William E. Burton, who at this time was
delighting his audiences at Burton's Theater on Chambers
Street. In my early life when Dr. Francis was called to
our house professionally the favorite dose he invariably prescribed
for nearly every ailment was "calomel and jalap."</p>

<p>One day during school hours at Miss Forbes's I was
suddenly summoned to return to my home. I soon discovered
after my arrival that I was in the presence of a tribunal
composed of my parents and Dr. Francis. I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
completely at a loss to understand why I was recalled with,
what seemed to me, such undue haste, as I was entirely unconscious
of any misdemeanor. I soon discovered, however,
that I was in great trouble. It seems that a young
girl from Santa Cruz, a boarding pupil at our school, had
died of a malady known at this period as "iliac passion,"
but now as appendicitis. Her attending physician was
Dr. Ralph I. Bush, a former surgeon in the British Navy,
and I soon learned to my dismay that I was accused of
having made an indiscreet remark in regard to his management
of my schoolmate's case, although to this day I
have never known exactly how Dr. Francis, as our family
physician, was involved in the affair. I stood up as bravely
as I could under a rigid cross-examination, but, alas! I
had no remembrance whatever of making any remark that
could possibly offend. At any rate, Dr. Bush had given
Dr. Francis to understand that he was ready to settle the
affair according to the approved method of the day; but
Dr. Francis was a man of peace, and had no relish for the
code. Possibly, with the reputed activity of Sir Lucius
O'Trigger, Dr. Bush had already selected his seconds, as
I have seldom seen a man more unnerved than Dr. Francis
by what proved after all to be only a trifling episode.
Soon after my trying interview, however, explanations
followed, and the two physicians amicably adjusted the
affair.</p>

<p>It seems that this unfortunate entanglement arose from
a misunderstanding. There were two cases of illness at
Miss Forbes's school at the same time, the patient of Dr.
Bush already mentioned and another child suffering from
a broken arm whom Dr. Francis attended. He set the
limb but, as he was not proficient as a surgeon, the act
was criticized by the schoolgirls within my hearing. My
sense of loyalty to my family doctor caused me to utter
some childish remark in his defense which was possibly to
the effect that he was a great deal better doctor than Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Bush, who had failed to save the life of our late schoolmate.
In recalling this childish episode which caused me
so much anxiety I am surprised that such unnecessary attention
was paid to the passing remark of a mere child.</p>

<p>Dr. Francis was as proficient in quoting wise maxims as
Benjamin Franklin, whom he was said to resemble. One
of them which I recall is the epitome of wisdom: "If
thy hand be in a lion's mouth, get it out as fast as thou
canst."</p>

<p>I may here state, by the way, that in close proximity to
Dr. Francis's residence on Bond Street lived Dr. Eleazer
Parmly, the fashionable dentist of New York. He stood
high in public esteem and a few still living may remember
his pleasing address. He accumulated a large fortune
and I believe left many descendants.</p>

<p>The girls at Miss Forbes's school were taught needle
work and embroidery, for in my early days no young
woman's education was regarded as complete without
these accomplishments. I quote from memory an elaborate
sampler which bore the following poetical effusion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What is the blooming tincture of the skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To peace of mind and harmony within?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What the bright sparkling of the finest eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the soft soothing of a kind reply?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Can comeliness of form or face so fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With kindliness of word or deed compare?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No. Those at first the unwary heart may gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But these, these only, can the heart retain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It seems remarkable that after spending months in working
such effusive lines, or others similar to them, Miss
Forbes's pupils did not become luminaries of virtue and
propriety. If they did not their failure certainly could
not be laid at the door of their preceptress.</p>

<p>Miss Forbes personally taught the rudiments but Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Luther Jackson, the writing master, visited the school each
day and instructed his scholars in the Italian style of
chirography. Mr. Michael A. Gauvain taught French so
successfully that in a short time many of us were able to
place on the amateur boards a number of French plays.
Our audiences were composed chiefly of admiring parents,
who naturally viewed the performances with paternal partiality
and no doubt regarded us as incipient Rachels. I
remember as if it were only yesterday a play in which I
took one of the principal parts&mdash;"Athalie," one of Jean
Racine's plays.</p>

<p>This mode of education was adopted in Paris by
Madame Campan, the instructor of the French nobility
as well as of royalty during the First Empire. In her
manuscript memoirs, addressed to the children of her
brother, "Citizen" Edmond Charles Genet, who was then
living in America, and of which I have an exact copy, she
dwells upon the histrionic performances by her pupils,
among whom were Queen Hortense and my husband's
aunt, Eliza Monroe, daughter of President James Monroe
and subsequently the wife of Judge George Hay of Virginia.
She gives a graphic account of the Emperor attending
one of these plays, when "Esther," one of Racine's
masterpieces, was performed.</p>

<p>The dancing master, who, of course, was an essential
adjunct of every well regulated school, was John J. Charraud.
He was a refugee from Hayti after the revolution
in that island, and opened his dancing-school in New York
on Murray Street, but afterwards gave his "publics" in
the City Hall. He taught only the cotillion and the three-step
waltz and came to our school three times a week for
this purpose. Much attention was given to poetry, and
I still recall the first piece I committed to memory, "Pity
the Sorrows of a Poor Old Man." My father thoroughly
believed in memorizing verse, and he always liberally rewarded
me for every piece I was able to recite. I may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
state, by the way, that Blair's Rhetoric was a textbook of
our school and the one which I most enjoyed.</p>

<p>Miss Forbes had a number of medals which the girls
were allowed to wear at stated periods for proficiency in
their studies as well as for exemplary deportment. There
was one of these which was known as the "excellence
medal," and the exultant pupil upon whom it was bestowed
was allowed the privilege of wearing it for two
weeks. Upon it was inscribed the well known proverb of
Solomon, "Many daughters have done virtuously, but
thou excellest them all."</p>

<p>Among the pleasant memories of my early life are the
dinners given by my father, when the distinguished men
of the day gathered around his hospitable board. In New
York at this time all the professional cooks and waiters
in their employ were colored men. Butlers were then unknown.
It was also before the days of <i>&agrave; la Russe</i> service,
and I remember seeing upon some of these occasions a
saddle of venison, while at the opposite end of the table
there was always a Westphalia ham. Fresh salmon was
considered a <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>. Many different wines
were always served, and long years later in a conversation
with Gov. William L. Marcy, who was a warm friend of
my father, he told me he was present on one of these
occasions when seven different varieties of wine were
served. I especially remember a dinner given by him in
honor of Martin Van Buren. He was Vice-President of
the United States at the time and was accompanied to New
York by John Forsyth of Georgia, a member of Jackson's
cabinet. Some of the guests invited to meet him were
Gulian C. Verplanck, Thomas Morris, John C. Hamilton,
Philip Hone and Walter Bowne. The day previous to
this dinner my father received the following note from
Mr. Van Buren:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>Our friend Mr. Forsyth, is with me and you must send
him an invitation to dine with you to-morrow if, as I
suppose is the case, I am to have that honor.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Yours truly,</p>

<p class='indent4'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">M. Van Buren.</span><br />
Sunday, June 9, '33.</p>

<p>J. Campbell, Esq.</p></div>

<p>Martin Van Buren was a political friend of my father's
from almost his earliest manhood. Two years after he
was appointed Surrogate he received the following confidential
letter from Mr. Van Buren. As will be seen, it
was before the days when he wrote in full the prefix
"Van" to his name:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><i>Private.</i></p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>Mr. Hoyt wishes me to quiet your apprehensions on
the subject of the Elector.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I will state to you truly how
the matter stands. My sincere belief is that we shall
succeed; at the same time I am bound to admit that the
subject is full of difficulties. If the members were now,
and without extraneous influence, to settle the matter,
the result would be certain. But I know that uncommon
exertions have been, and are making, by the outdoor
friends of Adams &amp; Clay to effect a co-operation of
their forces in favor of a divided ticket. Look at the
"National Journal" of the 23d, and you will find an article,
prepared with care, to make influence there. A few
months ago Mr. Adams would have revolted at such a
publication. It is the desperate situation of his affairs
that has brought him to it. The friends of Clay (allowing
Adams more strength than he may have), have no
hopes of getting him (Clay) into the house, unless they
get a part of this State. The certain decline of Adams
in other parts &amp; the uncertainty of his strength in the
east alarm his friends on the same point. Thus both parties
are led to the adoption of desperate measures. Out
of N. England Adams has now no reason to expect more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
than his three or four votes in Maryland. A partial discomfiture
in the east may therefore bring him below Mr.
Clay's western votes, &amp; if it should appear that he (Adams)
cannot get into the house, the western votes would
go to Crawford. If nothing takes place materially to
change the present state of things, we hope to defeat their
plans here. But if you lose your Assembly ticket, there
is no telling the effect it may produce, &amp; my chief object
in being thus particular with you is to conjure your utmost
attention to that subject. About the Governor's
election there is no sort of doubt. I am not apt to be
confident, &amp; <i>I aver that the matter is so.</i> But it is to the
Assembly that interested men look, and the difference of
ten members will (with the information the members can
have when they come to act) be decisive in the opinion of
the present members as to the complexion of the next
house. There are <i>other points of view</i> which I cannot
now state to you, in which the result I speak of may seriously
affect the main question. Let me therefore entreat
your serious attention to this matter. <i>Be careful of this.</i>
Your city is a gossiping place, &amp; what you tell to one man
in confidence is soon in the mouths of hundreds. You
can impress our friends on this subject without connecting
me with it. Do so.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Your sincere friend,</p>

<p class='indent4'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">M. V. Buren.</span><br />
Albany, Octob. 28, 1824.<br />
</p>

<p>James Campbell, Esq.</p></div>

<p>The Mr. Hoyt referred to in the opening sentence of
this letter was Jesse Hoyt, another political friend of my
father's who, under Van Buren's administration, was Collector
of the Port of New York. During my child life on
Long Island he made my father occasional visits, and in
subsequent years lived opposite us on Hubert Street. He
was the first one to furnish me with a practical illustration
of man's perfidy. As a very young child I consented
to have my ears pierced, when Mr. Hoyt volunteered to
send me a pair of coral ear-rings, but he failed to carry
out his promise. I remember reading some years ago sev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>eral
letters addressed to Hoyt by "Prince" John Van
Buren which he begins with "Dear Jessica."</p>

<p>Table appointments at this time were most simple and
unostentatious. Wine coolers were found in every well
regulated house, but floral decorations were seldom seen.
At my father's dinners, given upon special occasions,
the handsome old silver was always used, much of which
formerly belonged to my mother's family. The forks and
spoons were of heavy beaten silver, and the knives were
made of steel and had ivory handles. Ice cream was always
the dessert, served in tall pyramids, and the universal
flavor was vanilla taken directly from the bean, as
prepared extracts were then unknown. I have no recollection
of seeing ice water served upon any well-appointed
table, as modern facilities for keeping it had yet to appear,
and cold water could always be procured from
pumps on the premises. The castors, now almost obsolete,
containing the usual condiments, were <i>de rigueur</i>; while
the linen used in our home was imported from Ireland,
and in some cases bore the coat of arms of the United
States with its motto, "<i>E Pluribus Unum</i>." My father's
table accommodated twenty persons and the dinner hour
was three o'clock. These social functions frequently
lasted a number of hours, and when it became necessary
the table was lighted by lamps containing sperm oil and
candles in candelabra. These were the days when men
wore ruffled shirt fronts and high boots.</p>

<p>I still have in my possession an acceptance from William
B. Astor, son of John Jacob Astor, to a dinner given
by my father, written upon very small note paper and
folded in the usual style of the day:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. W. Astor will do himself the honor to dine with
Mr. Campbell to-day agreeable to his polite invitation.</p>

<p>May 28th.</p>

<p>
James Campbell Esq.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubert Street.</p>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>I well remember a stag dinner given by my father when
I was a child at which one of the guests was Philip Hone,
one of the most efficient and energetic Mayors the City of
New York has ever had. He is best known to-day by his
remarkable diary, edited by Bayard Tuckerman, which is
a veritable storehouse of events relating to the contemporary
history of the city. Mr. Hone had a fine presence
with much elegance of manner, and was truly one of
nature's noblemen. Many years ago Arent Schuyler de
Peyster, to whom I am indebted for many traditions of
early New York society, told me that upon one occasion
a conversation occurred between Philip Hone and his
brother John, a successful auctioneer, in which the latter
advocated their adoption of a coat of arms. Philip's response
was characteristic of the man: "I will have no
arms except those Almighty God has given me."</p>

<p>In this connection, and <i>&agrave;propos</i> of heraldic designs and
their accompaniments, I have been informed that the Hon.
Daniel Manning, Cleveland's Secretary of the Treasury,
used upon certain of his cards of invitation a crest with
the motto, "Aquila non capit muscas" ("The eagle does
not catch flies"). This brings to my mind the following
anecdote from a dictionary of quotations translated into
English in 1826 by D. N. McDonnel: "Casti, an Italian
poet who fled from Russia on account of having written
a scurrilous poem in which he made severe animadversions
on the Czarina and some of her favorites, took refuge in
Austria. Joseph II. upon coming in contact with him
asked him whether he was not afraid of being punished
there, as well as in Russia, for having insulted his high
friend and ally. The bard's steady reply was 'Aquila non
capit muscas.'" Sir Francis Bacon, however, was the
first in the race, as long before either Manning or Casti
were born he made use of these exact words in his "Jurisdiction
of the Marshes."</p>

<p>In my early days John H. Contoit kept an ice cream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
garden on Broadway near White Street, and it was the
first establishment of this kind, as far as I know, in New
York. During the summer months it was a favorite resort
for many who sought a cool place and pleasant society,
where they might eat ice cream under shady vines
and ornamental lattice work. The ice cream was served
in high glasses, and the price paid for it was twelve and
one-half cents. Nickles and dimes were of course unknown,
but the Mexican shilling, equivalent to twelve and
one-half cents, and the quarter of a dollar, also Mexican,
were in circulation.</p>

<p>There were no such places as lunchrooms and tearooms
in my early days, and the only restaurant of respectability
was George W. Browne's "eating house," which was
largely frequented by New Yorkers. The proprietor had
a very pretty daughter, Mrs. Coles, who was brought
prominently before the public in the summer of 1841 as
the heroine of an altercation between August Belmont
and Edward Heyward, a prominent South Carolinian, followed
by a duel in Maryland in which Belmont is said to
have been so seriously wounded as to retain the scars until
his death.</p>

<p>Alexander T. Stewart's store, corner of Broadway and
Chambers Street, was the fashionable dry goods emporium,
and for many years was without a conspicuous rival. William
I. Tenney, Horace Hinsdale, Henry Gelston, and
Frederick and Henry G. Marquand were jewelers. Tenney's
store was on Broadway near Murray Street; Gelston's
was under the Astor House on the corner of
Barclay Street and Broadway; Hinsdale's was on the east
side of Broadway and Cortlandt Street; and the Marquands
were on the west side of Broadway between Cortlandt
and Dey Streets.</p>

<p>James Leary bore the palm in New York as the fashionable
hatter, and his shop was on Broadway under the
Astor House. As was usual then with his craft, he kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
individual blocks for those of his customers who had heads
of unusual dimensions. In his show window he sometimes
exhibited a block of remarkable size which was
adapted to fit the heads of a distinguished trio, Daniel
Webster, General James Watson Webb, and Charles Augustus
Davis. Miss Anna Leary of Newport, his daughter
and a devout Roman Catholic, received the title of
Countess from the Pope.</p>

<p>The most prominent hostelry in New York before the
days of the Astor House was the City Hotel on lower
Broadway. I have been informed that the site upon
which it stood still belongs to representatives of the Boreel
family, descendants of the first John Jacob Astor. Another,
but of a later period, was the American Hotel on
Broadway near the Astor House. It was originally the
town house of John C. Vanden Heuvel, a member of one
of New York's most exclusive families. Upon Mr. Vanden
Heuvel's death this house passed into the possession
of his son-in-law, John C. Hamilton, who changed it into
a hotel. Its proprietor was William B. Cozzens, who was
so long and favorably known as a hotel proprietor. At
this same time he had charge of the only hotel at West
Point, and it was named after him. If any army officers
survive who were cadets during Cozzens's <i>r&eacute;gime</i> they will
recall with pleasure his kindly bearing and attractive
manner. Mr. Vanden Heuvel's country residence was in
the vicinity of Ninetieth Street overlooking the Hudson
River. His other daughters were Susan Annette, who
married Mr. Thomas S. Gibbes of South Carolina, and
Justine, who became the wife of Gouverneur S. Bibby, a
cousin of my husband.</p>

<p>As I first remember Union Square it was in the outskirts
of the city. Several handsome houses had a few
years previously been erected there by James F. Penniman,
the son-in-law of Mr. Samuel Judd, the latter of
whom amassed a large fortune by the manufacture and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
sale of oil and candles. Miss Lydia Kane, a sister of the
elder De Lancey Kane and a noted wit of the day, upon
a certain occasion was showing some strangers the sights
of New York, and in passing these houses was asked by
whom they were occupied. "That one," she responded,
indicating the one in which the Pennimans themselves
lived, "is occupied by one of the <i>illuminati</i> of the city."</p>

<p>Robert L. Stuart and his brother Alexander were proprietors
of a large candy store on the corner of Chambers
and Greenwich Streets, under the firm name of R. L. &amp;
A. Stuart. Their establishment was a favorite resort of
the children of the day, who were as much addicted to
sweets as are their more recent successors. "Broken
candy" was a specialty of this firm, and was sold at a very
low price. Alexander Stuart frequently waited upon customers,
and as a child I have often chattered with him
over the counter. He never married.</p>

<p>The principal markets were Washington on the North
River, and Fulton on the east side. The marketing was
always done by the mistress of each house accompanied
by a servant bearing a large basket. During the season
small girls carried strawberries from door to door, calling
out as they went along; and during the summer months
hot corn, carried in closed receptacles made for the purpose,
was sold by colored men, whose cries could be heard
in every part of the city.</p>

<p>Mrs. Isaac Sayre's bakery was an important shop for
all housewives, and her homemade jumbles and pound
cake were in great demand. Her plum cake, too, was
exceptionally good, and it is an interesting fact that it
was she who introduced cake in boxes for weddings. Her
shop survived for an extraordinary number of years and,
as far as I know, may still exist and be kept by some of
her descendants.</p>

<p>I must not omit to speak of a peculiar custom which in
this day of grace, when there are no longer any old women,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
seems rather odd. A woman immediately after her marriage
wore a cap made of some light material, which she
invariably tied with strings under her chin. Most older
women were horrified at the thought of gray hairs, and
immediately following their appearance false fronts were
purchased, over which caps were worn. I well recall that
some of the most prominent women of the day concealed
fine heads of hair in this grotesque fashion. Baldheaded
men were not tolerated, and "scratches" or wigs provided
the remedy. Marriage announcements were decidedly informal.
When the proper time arrived for the world to
be taken into the confidence of a young couple, they walked
upon Broadway arm in arm, thus announcing that their
marriage was imminent.</p>

<p>A dinner given in my young days by my parents to
Mr. and Mrs. William C. Rives still lingers in my memory.
Mr. Rives had just been appointed to his second
mission to France, and with his wife was upon the eve of
sailing for his new post of duty. I remember that it was
a large entertainment, but the only guests whom I recall
in addition to the guests of honor were Mr. and Mrs.
James A. Hamilton. He was a son of Alexander Hamilton,
and was at the time United States District Attorney
in New York. It seems strange, indeed, that the other
guests should have escaped my memory, but a head-dress
worn by Mrs. Hamilton struck my young fancy and I
have never forgotten it. As I recall that occasion I can
see her handsome face surmounted by a huge fluffy pink
cap. This Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton were the parents of
Alexander Hamilton, the third, who married Angelica,
daughter of Maturin Livingston, and who, by the way, as
I remember, was one of the most graceful dancers and
noted belles of her day.</p>

<p>Thomas Morris, son of Robert Morris the great financier
of the Revolution, was my father's life-long friend.
He was an able <i>raconteur</i>, and I recall many conversa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>tions
relating to his early life, a portion of which had
been spent in Paris at its celebrated Polytechnic School.
One incident connected with his career is especially interesting.
When the sordid Louis Philippe, then the
Duke of Orleans, was wandering in this country, teaching
in his native tongue "the young idea how to shoot," he
was the guest for a time of Mr. Morris. Several years
later when John Greig, a Scotchman and prominent
citizen of Canandaigua, New York, was about to sail for
France, Mr. Morris gave him a letter of introduction to
the Duke. Upon his arrival in Havre after a lengthy
voyage he found much to his surprise that Louis Philippe
was comfortably seated upon the throne of France.
Under these altered conditions he hesitated to present
his letter, but after mature consideration sought an
audience with the new King; and it is a pleasing commentary
upon human nature to add that he was welcomed
with open arms. The King had by no means forgotten
the hospitality he had received in America, and especially
the many favors extended by the Morris family. Mr.
Morris's wife was Miss Sarah Kane, daughter of Colonel
John Kane, and she was beautiful even in her declining
years. She also possessed the wit so characteristic of the
Kanes, who, by the way, were of Celtic origin, being descended
from John Kane who came from Ireland in 1752.
She was the aunt of the first De Lancey Kane, who married
the pretty Louisa Langdon, the granddaughter of
John Jacob Astor. Their daughter, Emily Morris, made
frequent visits to our house. She was renowned for both
beauty and wit. I remember seeing several verses addressed
to her, the only lines of which I recall are as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That calm collected look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though her pulses beat by book.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another intimate friend of my father was Frederick
de Peyster, who at a later day became President of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
New York Historical Society. He habitually took Sunday
tea with us, and always received a warm welcome
from the juvenile members of the family with whom he
was a great favorite. He was devoted to children, and
delighted our young hearts by occasional presents of game-chickens
which at once became family pets.</p>

<p>In 1823 and 1824 my father's sympathies were deeply
enlisted in behalf of the Greeks in their struggles for independence
from the Turkish rule. It will be remembered
that this was the cause to which Byron devoted his
last energies. The public sentiment of the whole country
was aroused to a high pitch of excitement, and meetings
were held not only for the purpose of lending moral support
and encouragement to the Greeks, but also for raising
funds for their assistance. Among those to whom my
father appealed was his friend, Rudolph Bunner, a highly
prominent citizen of Oswego, N.Y. Although a lawyer
he did not practice his profession, but devoted himself
chiefly to his extensive landed estates in Oswego county.
He was wealthy and generous, a good liver and an eloquent
political speaker. He served one term in Congress
where, as elsewhere, he was regarded as a man of decided
ability. He died about 1833 at the age of nearly seventy.
The distinguished New York lawyer, John Duer, married
his daughter Anne, by whom he had thirteen children,
one of whom, Anna Henrietta, married the late Pierre
Paris Irving, a nephew of Washington Irving and at one
time rector of the Episcopal church at New Brighton,
Staten Island. Mr. Bunner's letter in response to my
father's appeal is not devoid of interest, and is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Oswego</span>, 12 Jan'y 1824.</p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>Though I have not written to you yet you were not so
soon forgotten. Nor can you so easily be erased from my
memory as my negligence might seem to imply. In truth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
few persons have impressed my mind with a deeper sentiment
of respect than yourself; you have that of open
and frank in your character which if not in my own, is
yet so congenial to my feelings that I shall much regret
if my habitual indolence can lose me such a friend. Your
request in favor of the Greeks will be hard to comply
with. If I can be a contributor in a humble way to their
success by my exertions here they shall not want them,
but I fear the <i>angusta res domi</i> may press too heavily
upon us to permit of an effectual benevolence. If you
wanted five hundred men six feet high with sinewy arms
and case hardened constitutions, bold spirits and daring
adventurers who would travel upon a bushel of corn and
a gallon of whiskey per man from the extreme point of
the world to Constantinople we could furnish you with
them, but I doubt whether they could raise the money to
pay their passage from the gut of Gibraltar upwards.
The effort however shall be made and if we can not shew
ourselves rich we will at least manifest our good will.
Though Greece touches few Yankee settlers thro the medium
of classical associations yet a people struggling to
free themselves from foreign bondage is sure to find warm
hearts in every native of the wilderness. We admire
your noble efforts and if we do not imitate you it is because
our purses are as empty as a Boetian's skull is
thick. We know so little of what is <i>really</i> projecting in
the cabinets of Europe that we are obliged to believe implicitly
in newspaper reports, and we are perhaps foolish
in hoping that the Holy Alliance intends to take the Spanish
part of the New World under their protection. In
such an event our backwoodsmen would spring with the
activity of squirrels to the assistance of the regenerated
Spaniards and perhaps <i>there</i> we might fight more effectually
the battle for universal Freedom than either at
Thermopyl&aelig; or Marathon. There indeed we might strike
a blow that would break up the deep foundations of despotic
power so as that neither art or force could again
collect and cement the scattered elements. We are too
distant from Greece to make the Turks feel our physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
strength and what we can do thro money and sympathy
is little in comparison with what we could if they were
so near as that we might in addition pour out the tide of
an armed northern population to sweep their shores and
overcome the tyrants like one of their pestilential winds.
Nevertheless, sympathy is a wonderful power and the
sympathy of a free nation like our own will not lose its
moral effect. I calculate strongly on this. It is a more
refined and rational kind of chivalry&mdash;this interest and
activity in the fate of nations struggling to break the oppressor's
rod, and it should be encouraged even where it
is not directed so as to give it all adequate force. They
who would chill it, who would reason about the why and
the wherefore ought to recollect that such things can not
be called forth by the art of man&mdash;they must burst spontaneously
from his nature and be directed by his wisdom
for the benefit of his kind.... We are all here real
Radical Democrats and though some of us came in at the
eleventh hour we will not go back, but on&mdash;on&mdash;on though
certain of missing the penny fee. In truth this is the
difference between real conviction and the calculating
policy which takes sides according to what it conceives
the vantage ground. A converted politician is as obstinate
in his belief as one born in the faith. The man of
craft changes his position according to the varying aspect
of the political heavens. The one plays a game&mdash;the
other sees as much of reality (or thinks he sees) in
politicks as he does in his domestic affairs and is as earnest
in the one as the other.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Salve&mdash;<span class='correction' title='Kai Chaire'>&#922;&#945;&#8054; &#935;&#945;&#8150;&#961;&#949;</span></p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">R. Bunner</span>.</p>


<p>8 o'clock.</p>

<p>I have had a full meeting for your Greeks&mdash;and found
my men of more mettle than I hoped for. We will do
something thro the <i>Country</i>&mdash;We have set the Parsons
to work and one shilling a head will make a good donation.
We think we can give you 4 or 5 hundred
dollars.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bunner was over sixty years old when he went to
live in Oswego, but he soon became identified with the
interests of the place and added much by his activities to
its local renown. In an undated letter to my father, he
thus expatiates upon his situation in his adopted home,
and paints its advantages in no uncertain colors:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am here unquestionably an exile but I will never dispond
at my fate nor whimper because my own folly, want
of tact or the very malice of the times have placed me in
Patmos when I desire a more splendid theatre. I can
here be useful to my family&mdash;to my district. I can live
cheaply, increase my fortune, be upon a par with the
best of my neighbors, which I prefer to the feasts of your
ostentatious mayor or the more real luxury of Phil Brasher's
Table. Our population is small, our society contracted,
but we are growing rapidly in numbers; and the
society we have is in my opinion and to my taste fully
equal to anything in your home. We possess men of intelligence
without pretention, active men as Jacob Barker
without his roguery&mdash;men whom nature intended to flourish
at St. James, but whose fate fortune in some fit of
prolifick humor fixed and nailed to this Sinope. We have
however to mitigate the cold spring breezes of the lake a
fall unrivalled in mildness and in beauty even in Italy,
the land of poetry and passion. We have a whole lake
in front, whose clear blue waters are without a parallel
in Europe. We have a beautiful river brawling at our
feet, the banks of which gently slope and when our village
is filled I will venture to say that in point of beauty,
health and variety of prospect it has <i>nil simile aut
secundum</i>.</p></div>

<p>Our house was the rendezvous of many of the learned
and literary men of the day, who would sit for hours in
the library discussing congenial topics. Among others I
well recall the celebrated jurist, Ogden Hoffman. He had
an exceptionally melodious voice, and I have often heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
him called "the silver-tongued orator." It has been asserted
that in criminal cases a jury was rarely known to
withstand his appeal. He married for his second wife
Virginia E. Southard, a daughter of Judge Samuel L.
Southard of New Jersey, who throughout Monroe's two
administrations was Secretary of War. In the "Wealthy
Citizens of New York," edited in 1845 by Moses Y. Beach,
an early owner in part of <i>The New York Sun</i>, the Hoffman
family is thus described: "Few families, for so few
a number of persons as compose it, have cut 'a larger
swath' or 'bigger figure' in the way of posts and preferment.
Talent, and also public service rendered, martial
gallantry, poetry, judicial acumen, oratory, all have their
lustre mingled with this name." I regard this statement
as just and truthful.</p>

<p>Still another valued associate of my father was Hugh
Maxwell, a prominent member of the New York bar. In
his earlier life he was District Attorney and later Collector
of the Port of New York. The Maxwells owned a pleasant
summer residence at Nyack-on-the-Hudson, where we
as children made occasional visits. Many years later one
of my daughters formed an intimate friendship with Hugh
Maxwell's granddaughter, Virginia De Lancey Kearny,
subsequently Mrs. Ridgely Hunt, which terminated only
with the latter's death in 1897.</p>

<p>From my earliest childhood Gulian C. Verplanck was
a frequent guest at our house. He and my father formed
an intimacy in early manhood which lasted throughout
life. Mr. Verplanck was graduated from Columbia College
in 1801, the youngest Bachelor of Arts who, up to
that time, had received a diploma from that institution of
learning. Both he and my father found in politics an all-absorbing
topic of conversation, especially as both of them
took an active part in state affairs. I have many letters,
one of them written as early as 1822, from Mr. Verplanck
to my father bearing upon political matters in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
New York. For four terms he represented his district in
Congress, while later he served in the State Senate and
for many years was Vice Chancellor of the University of
the State of New York. He was an ardent Episcopalian
and a vestryman in old Trinity Parish. He was a brilliant
conversationalist, and his tastes, like my father's,
were decidedly literary. In connection with William Cullen
Bryant and Robert C. Sands, he edited <i>The Talisman</i>,
an annual which continued through the year 1827. Mr.
Verplanck lived to an old age and survived my father for
a long time, but he did not forget his old friend. Almost
a score of years after my father's death, on the 4th of
July, 1867, Mr. Verplanck delivered a scholarly oration
before the Tammany Society of New York, in which he
paid the following glowing tribute to his memory:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In those days James Campbell, for many years the Surrogate
of this city, was a powerful leader at Tammany
Hall, and from character and mind alone, without any
effort or any act of popularity. He was not college-bred,
but he was the son of a learned father, old Malcolm
Campbell, who had been trained at Aberdeen, the great
school of Scotch Latinity. James Campbell was, like his
father, a good classical scholar, and he was a sound lawyer.
He was not only an assiduous, a kind, sound and
just magistrate, but one of unquestioned ability. In his
days of Surrogateship, the days of universal reporting,
either in the multitudinous volumes in white law bindings
on the shelves of lawyers, or in the crowded columns
of the daily papers, had not quite arrived though they
were just at hand. Had he lived and held office a few
years later, I do not doubt that he would have ranked
with the great luminaries of legal science. As it is, I
fear that James Campbell's reputation must share the
fate of the reputations of many able and eminent men in
all professions who can not</p>

</div></div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The most prominent newspaper in New York in my
early days was the <i>Courier and Enquirer</i>, edited by General
James Watson Webb, a man of distinguished ability.
He began his literary career by editing the <i>Morning
Courier</i>, but as this was not a very successful venture he
purchased the <i>New York Enquirer</i> from Mordecai Manasseh
Noah, and in 1829 merged the two papers. Several
leading journalists began their active careers in his
office, among others James Gordon Bennett, subsequently
editor of <i>The New York Herald</i>, Henry J. Raymond, the
founder of <i>The New York Times</i>, and Charles King, father
of Madam Kate King Waddington and Mrs. Eugene
Schuyler, who at one time edited <i>The American</i> and subsequently
became the honored president of Columbia College.
James Reed Spaulding, a New Englander by birth,
was also connected with the <i>Courier and Enquirer</i> for
about ten years. In 1860 he became a member of the
staff of the New York <i>World</i>, which, by the way, was
originally intended to be a semi-religious sheet. During
President Lincoln's administration General Webb sold the
<i>Courier and Enquirer</i> to the <i>World</i>, and the two papers
were consolidated. William Seward Webb of New York
was a son of this General Webb, and the latter's daughter,
Mrs. Catharine Louisa Benton, the widow of Colonel
James G. Benton of the army, lived until recently in
Washington, and is one of the pleasant reminders left me
of the old days of my New York life.</p>

<p><i>The New York Herald</i> was established some years after
the <i>Courier and Enquirer</i> and was from the first a flourishing
sheet. It was exceptionally spicy, and it dealt so
much in personalities that my father, who was a gentleman
of the old school with very conservative views, was
not, to say the least, one of its strongest admirers. Several
years before the Civil War, at a time when the anti-slavery
cauldron was at its boiling point, its editor, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
elder James Gordon Bennett, dubbed its three journalistic
contemporaries in New York, the World, the Flesh, and
the Devil&mdash;the <i>World</i>, representing human life with all
its pomps and vanities; the <i>Times</i>, as a sheet as vacillating
as the flesh; and the <i>Tribune</i>, as the virulent champion of
abolition, the counterpart of the Devil himself.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1842 James Gordon Bennett took
his bride, who was Miss Henrietta Agnes Crean of New
York, to Washington on their wedding journey. As this
season had been unusually severe, great distress prevailed,
and a number of society women organized a charity ball
for the relief of the destitute. It was given under the
patronage of Mrs. Madison (the ex-President's widow),
Mrs. Samuel L. Gouverneur (my husband's mother), Mrs.
Benjamin Ogle Tayloe (Julia Maria Dickinson of Troy,
New York), and other society matrons, and, as can readily
be understood, was a financial as well as a social success.
Tickets were eagerly sought, and Mr. Bennett applied for
them for his wife and himself. At first he was refused,
but after further consideration Mrs. Madison and Mrs.
Gouverneur of the committee upon invitations granted his
request on condition that no mention of the ball should
appear in the columns of the <i>Herald</i>. Mr. Bennett and
his wife accordingly attended the entertainment, where
the latter was much admired and danced to her heart's
content. Two days later, however, much to the chagrin
and indignation of the managers, an extended account of
the ball appeared in the <i>Herald</i>. This incident will be
better appreciated when I state that at this time the personal
mention of a woman in a newspaper was an unheard-of
liberty. It was the old-fashioned idea that a woman's
name should occur but twice in print, first upon the occasion
of her marriage and subsequently upon the announcement
of her death. My husband once remarked to me,
upon reading a description of a dress worn by one of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
daughters at a ball, that if such a notice had appeared in
a newspaper in connection with his sister he or his father
would have thrashed the editor.</p>

<p>John L. O'Sullivan, a prominent literary man and in
subsequent years minister to Portugal, edited a periodical
called the <i>Democratic Review</i>, which was published in
magazine form. I well recall the first appearance of
<i>Harper's Magazine</i> in June, 1850, and that for some time
it had but few illustrations. <i>The Evening</i> Post was established
in 1801, many years prior to the <i>Courier and
Enquirer</i>. It was always widely read, was democratic in
its tone, and its editorials were highly regarded. While
I lived in New York, and also much later, it was edited
by William Cullen Bryant, who was as gifted as an editor
as he was as a poet. I have before me now a reprint of
the first issue of this paper, dated Monday, November 16,
1801. I copy some of the advertisements, as many old

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>SCHOOL-DAYS AND EARLY FRIENDS</h3>


<p>I must return to my school days. After several years
spent at Miss Forbes's my parents decided to afford
me greater advantages for study, and especially for
becoming more proficient in the French language, and I
was accordingly sent to Madame Eloise Chegaray's institution,
which for many years was regarded as the most
prominent girls' school in the country. It was a large
establishment located on the corner of Houston and Mulberry
Streets, where she accommodated boarding pupils
as well as day scholars. Many years later this building
was sold to the religious order of the <i>Sacre Coeur</i>. The
school hours were from nine until three, with an intermission
at twelve o'clock. The vacation, as at Miss Forbes's,
was limited to the month of August. The discipline was
not so rigid as at Miss Forbes's, as Madame Chegaray,
who, by the way, taught her pupils to address her as
<i>Tante</i>, governed almost entirely by affection. She possessed
unusual grace of manner and great kindness of
heart, and her few surviving pupils hold her name and
memory in the highest esteem. Her early history is of
exceptional interest. She was a daughter of Pierre Prosper
D&eacute;sabaye, and came with her father and the other
members of his family from Paris to New York on account
of his straitened circumstances, caused by an insurrection
in San Domingo, where his family owned large estates.
Madame Chegaray commenced as a mere girl to teach
French in a school in New Brunswick, New Jersey, kept by
Miss Sophie Hay, and was retained on account of the extreme
purity of her accent.</p>

<p>I chance to have in my possession Madame Chegaray's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
own account of her early struggles after leaving Miss Hay,
from which I take great pleasure in quoting:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Among the royal <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> to this country was the Countess
de St. Memin who kept a school. As my brother
Marc had removed to New York we joined him and I was
employed as French governess in the school of Mademoiselle
de St. Memin. But I still knew nothing but to speak
my own native tongue. One day I was bewailing my
ignorance in the presence of M. Felix de Beaujour, Consul
General of France to this country.</p>

<p>"Mlle. Eloise," he said, "quand on sait lire on peut
toujours s'istruire."</p>

<p>This gave me a new thought. I set seriously about
studying. I took classes. What I was to teach on the
morrow I studied the night before. I worked early and
late. With the return of Louis Philippe the St. Memins
returned to France and I became a teacher in the
school of Madame Nau. Here I studied and taught. On
me fell all the burden of the school while Madame Nau
amused herself with harp and piano. For this I had only
$150 a year. To further assist my family I knit woolen
jackets. They were a great deal of trouble to me and I
was very grateful to Madame Isaac Iselin, the mother of
Mr. Adrain Iselin, who always found purchasers to give
me excellent prices. Ah, I was young then. I thought
that I earned that money. Now I know that it was only
her delicate manner of doing me a service. Madame Iselin
bought my jackets and then gave them away.</p>

<p>Feeling that I was worth much to Madame Nau, and
that I must do more to relieve my brother Marc, my
brother Gustave having gone to sea with Captain de
Peyster, I begged Madame Nau to give me $250. This
she refused. Her reply, "Me navra le coeur," overwhelmed
me. It was Saturday. I started home in great
distress and met on the way the dear admirable Miss
Sophy Hay to whom I told my sorrow.</p>

<p>"Miss Hay," I exclaimed, "I will open a school for
myself." She tapped me on the forehead. "Do, dear
Eloise, and God will help you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>How all difficulties were smoothed away! The dear
Madame Iselin took charge of all my purchases, advancing
the money. They were very simple, those splint chairs
and carpets and tables, for we were simpler-minded then.
On the 1st of May 1814 I opened my school on Greenwich
Street with sixteen pupils. Good M. Roulet gave
me his two wards. I received several scholars from a
convent just closed and I had my nieces Am&eacute;line and
Laura B&eacute;rault de St. Maurice and Clara the daughter of
Marc [D&eacute;sabaye], who afterward married Ponty Lemoine,
the lawyer in whose office Charles O'Conor studied.
Thus was my school started, and I take this occasion
to express my gratitude to those who confided in so young
an instructress&mdash;for I was only twenty-two&mdash;the education
of their daughters, and I pray God to bless them and
their country....</p></div>

<p>Many well-known women were educated at this school,
and one of the first pupils was Miss Sarah Morris, the
granddaughter of Lewis Morris, the Signer, and the
mother of the senior Mrs. Hamilton Fish. A younger
sister of Mrs. Fish, Christine, who many years later was
a pupil of Madame Chegaray, and who is now Mrs. William
Preston Griffin of New York, ministered to Madame
Chegaray in her last illness, and told me that her parting
words to her were, "<i>Adieu, ch&egrave;re Christine, fid&egrave;le amie.</i>"
In spite of her extreme youth Madame Chegaray took an
exceptionally serious view of life, even refusing to wear
flowers in her bonnets or to sing, although she had a very
sweet voice. She dearly loved France, but she was a
broad-minded woman and her knowledge of American
affairs was as great as that of her own country. She
rounded out nearly a century of life, the greater part of
which was devoted to others, and I pay her the highest
tribute in my power when I say that she faced the many
vicissitudes of life with an undaunted spirit, and bequeathed
to her numerous pupils the inestimable boon of
a wonderful example.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>All the teachers in Madame Chegaray's school were
men, with the single exception of Mrs. Joseph McKee, the
wife of a Presbyterian clergyman. Among those who
taught were John Bigelow, who is still living in New
York at an advanced age, and who in subsequent years
was Secretary of State of New York and our Minister to
France; Thatcher T. Payne; Edward G. Andrew, who
became in the course of years a Bishop in the Methodist
Church; Professor Robert Adrain, who taught mathematics,
and who at the same time was one of the faculty of
Columbia College; and Lorenzo L. da Ponte. The latter
was a man of unusual versatility, and was especially distinguished
as a linguist. He taught us English literature
in such a successful manner that we regarded that study
merely as a recreation. Mr. da Ponte was a son of Lorenzo
da Ponte, a Venitian of great learning, who after
coming to this country rendered such conspicuous services
in connection with Dominick Lynch in establishing Italian
opera in New York. He was also a professor of Italian
for many years in Columbia College, the author of a
book of sonnets, several works relating to the Italian
language and of his own life, which was published in
three volumes. Mr. Samuel Ward, a noted character of
the day, the brother of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and who
married Emily Astor, daughter of William B. Astor,
wrote an interesting memoir of him. Madame Chegaray
taught the highest classes in French. "If I had to give
up all books but two," she was fond of saying, "I would
choose the Gospels and La Fontaine's Fables. In one
you have everything necessary for your spiritual life; in
the other you have the epitome of all worldly wisdom."</p>

<p>When I entered Madame Chegaray's school she had
about a hundred pupils, a large number of whom were
from the Southern States. How well I remember the extreme
loyalty of the Southern girls to their native soil!
I can close my eyes and read the opening sentence of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
composition written by one of my comrades, Elodie Toutant,
a sister of General Pierre G. T. Beauregard of the
Confederate Army&mdash;"The South, the South, the beautiful
South, the garden spot of the United States." This
chivalric devotion to the soil whence they sprang apparently
was literally breathed into my Southern school companions
from the very beginning of their lives. Their
loyalty possessed a fascination for me, and although I
was born, reared and educated in a Northern State, I had
a tender feeling for the South, which still lingers with
me, for most of the friendships I formed at Madame Chegaray's
were with Southern girls.</p>

<p>My first day at Madame Chegaray's, like many other
beginnings, was something of an ordeal, but it was my
good fortune to meet almost immediately Henrietta
Croom, a daughter of Henry B. Croom, a celebrated botanist
of North Carolina, but who, with his family, had
spent much of his life in Tallahassee. Many are the
pleasant hours we spent together, but to my sorrow she
graduated at an early age, and a few months later embarked,
in company with her parents, a younger brother
and sister and an aunt, Mrs. Cammack, upon a vessel
called the <i>Home</i> for Charleston, South Carolina, where
they had planned to make their future residence. When
they had been several days at sea their vessel encountered
a severe storm off Cape Hatteras, and after a brave struggle
with the terrific elements every member of the family
sank with the ship within a few miles of the spot where
the Crooms had formerly lived. This occurred on the 9th
of October, 1836. They had as fellow voyagers a brother
of Madame Chegaray, who, with his wife and three
children, had only just left the school to make the voyage
to Charleston. They, too, lost their lives. Over Madame
Chegaray's school as well as her household at once hung
a pall, and gloom and mourning prevailed on every side;
indeed, the whole city of New York shared in our sorrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The newspapers of the day were filled with accounts of
this direful disaster, but there were few survivors to tell
the tale. My late playmate, Henrietta Croom, was one
of the most popular girls at school, possessing great attractions
of both mind and person, and, although at the
time she was merely a child in years, the New Year's address
of a prominent daily newspaper of the day contained
an extended reference to her which strongly appealed
to my grief-stricken fancy. Though more than
sixty years have passed I have always preserved it with
great care in memory of the "sweet damsel" of long ago.
The following are the lines to which I have just referred:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear Home! what magic trembles in the word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each bosom's fountain at its sound is stirred,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On earth no more those voyagers' steps shall roam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cast their anchor at an Heavenly "Home"!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High beat their hearts, when first their fated prow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut through the surge that boils above them now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They saw in vision rapt their fatherland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt once more its odorous breezes bland&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frozen North receded from their sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fancy's dream entranced them with delight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! who can tell what pangs their soul assail'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every hope of life and rescue fail'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When wild despair their throbbing bosoms wrung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winds and waves a doleful requiem sung?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood the husband whose protecting arm<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The Croom family owned large plantations in the South
together with many slaves. A short time after it was
definitely known that not a member of the family had
survived, there was a legal contest over the estate by the
representatives of both sides of the household, the Crooms
and the Armisteads. Eminent members of the Southern
bar were employed, among whom were Judge John
McPherson Berrien of Savannah and Joseph M. White of
Florida, often called "Florida White." After about
twenty years of litigation the suit was decided in favor
of the Armisteads. It seems that as young Croom, a lad
of twelve, nearly reached the shore he was regarded as the
survivor, and his grandmother, Mrs. Henrietta Smith of
Newbern, North Carolina, his nearest living relative, became
his heir. I have always understood that this hotly
contested case has since been regarded as a judicial
precedent.</p>

<p>A few days after receiving the news of the shipwreck
of the <i>Home</i>, I found by accident in my father's library
an <i>&eacute;dition de luxe</i>, just published in London, of "Les
Dames de Byron." In it was an illustration entitled
"Leila," which bore a wonderful resemblance to my best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
friend, Henrietta Croom. Beneath were the following
lines, which seemed to suggest her history, and the coincidence
was so apparent that I immediately committed
them to memory, and it is from memory that I now give
them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She sleeps beneath the wandering wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! had she but an earthly grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This aching heart and throbbing breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would seek and share her narrow rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was a form of life and light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That soon became a part of sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rose where'er I turned mine eye&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning-star of memory.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another schoolmate and friend of mine at Madame
Chegaray's was Josephine Habersham of Savannah, a
daughter of Joseph Habersham and a great-granddaughter
of General Joseph Habersham, who succeeded Timothy
Pickering as Postmaster General during Washington's
second term and retained the position under Adams and
Jefferson until the latter part of 1801. She was one of
Madame Chegaray's star pupils in music. She frequently
made visits to my home, remaining over Saturday and
Sunday, and delighted the family by playing in a most
masterly manner the Italian music then in vogue. A few
years after her return to her Southern home she married
her cousin, William Neyle Habersham, an accomplished
musician. For many years they lived in Savannah in the
greatest elegance, until the Civil War came to disturb
their tranquil dreams. Two young sons, both under
twenty-one, laid down their lives for the Southern cause
during that conflict. After their great sorrow music was
their chief solace, and they delighted their friends by
playing together on various musical instruments.</p>

<p>New Orleans was represented at our school by a famous
beauty, Catharine Alexander Chew, a daughter of
Beverly Chew, the Collector of the Port of New Orleans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and whose wife, Miss Maria Theodosia Duer, was a sister
of President William Alexander Duer of Columbia College.
He and Richard Relf, cashier of the Louisiana State
Bank, were the business partners and subsequently the
executors of the will of Daniel Clark of the same city, and
it was against them that the latter's daughter, Myra Clark
Gaines, the widow of General Edmund Pendleton Gaines,
U.S.A., fought her famous legal battles for over half a
century. Miss Chew married Judge Thomas H. Kennedy
of New Orleans and left many descendants. The sister
of General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, Elodie Toutant,
whom I have already mentioned, was also from Louisiana.
She was a studious girl, and a most attractive companion.
The original family name was Toutant, but towards the
close of the sixteenth century the last male descendant of
the family died, and an only surviving daughter having
married Sieur Paix de Beauregard, the name became
Toutant de Beauregard, the prefix <i>de</i> having subsequently
been dropped.</p>

<p>Still another friendship I formed at Madame Chegaray's
school was with Elizabeth Clarkson Jay, which through
life was a source of intense pleasure to me and lasted
until her pure and gentle spirit returned to its Maker.
She was the daughter of Peter Augustus Jay, a highly
respected lawyer, and a granddaughter of the distinguished
statesman, John Jay. She was a deeply religious woman,
and died a few years ago in New York after a life consecrated
to good works.</p>

<p>One of the brightest girls in my class was Sarah Jones,
a daughter of one of New York's most distinguished
jurists, Chancellor Samuel Jones. She and another
schoolmate of mine, Maria Brandegee, who lived in LeRoy
Place, were intimate and inseparable companions. The
mother of the latter belonged to a Creole family from
New Orleans, named D&eacute;slonde, and was the aunt of the
wife of John Slidell of Confederate fame. The Brande<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>gees
were devout Roman Catholics, while the members of
the Jones family were equally ardent Episcopalians.
Archbishop Hughes of New York was a welcome and frequent
visitor at the Brandegee house, where, in my
younger days, I frequently had the pleasure of meeting
him and listening to his attractive conversation. In this
manner Sarah Jones also came into contact with him.
Deeply impressed by his teachings, she followed him to the
Cathedral, where she soon became a regular attendant. In
the course of time she became a member of the Roman
Catholic Church, and a few years later entered the order
of the <i>Sacre Coeur</i>, at Manhattanville, where she eventually
became Mother Superior and remained as such for
many years.</p>

<p>Quite a number of years ago I was the guest of the family
of Charles O'Conor, the distinguished jurist and leader
of the New York bar, at his handsome home at Fort Washington,
a suburb of New York. He was the son of the
venerable Thomas O'Conor, editor of <i>The Shamrock</i>, the
first paper published in New York for Irish and Catholic
readers, and also the author of a history of the second
war with Great Britain. One afternoon Mr. O'Conor
suggested that I should accompany him upon a drive to
the Convent of the <i>Sacre Coeur</i> a few miles distant. He
was anxious to confer with Madame Mary Aloysia Hardey,
who was then Mother Superior. I was delighted to
accept this invitation, as Mr. O'Conor was an exceptionally
agreeable companion and his spare moments were but
few and far between. Before reaching our destination, I
remarked that Madame Jones, an old schoolmate of mine,
was an inmate of this Convent, and that I should be very
glad to see her again. Upon our arrival, Sarah Jones
greeted me in the parlor and seemed glad to see me after
the lapse of so many years. Leading as she was the life
of a <i>religieuse</i>, our topics of conversation were few, but
I noticed that she seemed interested in discussing her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
family, about whom evidently she was not well informed.
After a brief visit and while homeward bound, Mr.
O'Conor inquired whether Madame Jones knew that her
father, the Chancellor, was rapidly approaching death.
I replied that apparently she had no knowledge of his
serious condition, and several days later I saw his death
announced in a daily newspaper. Many years after my
interview with Sarah Jones I met at the residence of Mrs.
Henry R. Winthrop of New York an older sister of hers,
Mary Anna Schuyler Jones, who at the time was the
widow of the Reverend Dr. Samuel Seabury of the Episcopal
Church. We lunched together, and the conversation
naturally drifted back to other days and to my old
schoolmate, her sister, Sarah Jones. She told me that she
had seen but little of her in recent years, but related a
curious episode in regard to meeting her under unusual
circumstances. It seems that Mrs. Seabury, accompanied
by a young daughter, was returning from a visit to Europe,
when she noticed that the occupants of the adjoining
state-room were unusually quiet. In time she made
the discovery that they were nuns returning from a business
trip abroad. Upon examination of the passenger
list, she discovered to her astonishment that her sister,
Madame Jones, was occupying the adjoining room. They
met daily thereafter throughout the voyage, and afterwards
returned to their respective homes.</p>

<p>I especially remember an incident of my school-life
which was decidedly sensational. Sally Otis, a young and
pretty girl and a daughter of James W. Otis, then of New
York but formerly of Boston, was in the same class with
me. One morning we missed her from her accustomed
seat, but during the day we learned the cause of her absence.
The whole Otis family had been taken ill by drinking
poisoned coffee. Upon investigation the cook reported
that a package of coffee had been sent to the house, and,
taking it for granted that it had been ordered by some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
member of the household, she had used it for breakfast.
The whole matter was shrouded in mystery, and gossip
was rife. One story was that a vindictive woman concentrated
all of her malice upon a single member of the
family against whom she had a grievance and thus endangered
the lives of the whole Otis family. Fortunately,
none of the cases proved fatal, but several inmates of the
house became seriously ill.</p>

<p>A few years before I entered Madame Chegaray's
school, Virginia Scott, the oldest daughter of Major General
Winfield Scott, enjoyed <i>Tante's</i> tutelage for a number
of years. She was a rare combination of genius and
beauty, and, apart from her remarkable personality, was
a skilled linguist and an accomplished vocal and instrumental
musician. This unusual combination of gifts suggests
the Spanish saying: "Mira favorecida de Dios"
("Behold one favored of God!"). Her life, however,
was brief, though deeply interesting. In the first blush
of womanhood she accompanied her mother and sisters to
Europe, and, after several years spent in Paris, made a
visit to Rome, where she immediately became imbued with
profound religious convictions. Through the instrumentality
of Father Pierce Connelly, a convert to Catholicism,
she was received into the Roman Catholic Church while in
the Holy City, and made her profession of faith in the
Chapel of St. Ignatius, where the ceremony took place by
the special permission of the Most Rev. John Roothan,
General of the Jesuits. General Scott meanwhile had returned
to the United States, having been promoted to the
rank of Commander-in-Chief of the Army with headquarters
in Washington. Accompanied by her mother, Virginia
Scott returned to America and, after a short time
spent with her parents in Washington, drove to Georgetown
and, without their knowledge or consent, was received
there as an inmate of the "Convent of the Visitation."
Her family was bitterly opposed to the step, more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
especially her mother, whose indignation was so pronounced
that she never to the day of her death forgave
the Church for depriving her of her daughter's companionship.
General Scott, however, frequently visited her
in her cloistered home, and always manifested much consideration
for the Convent as well as for the nuns, the
daily companions of his daughter. Although she possessed
a proud and imperious nature, combined with great
personal beauty and much natural <i>hauteur</i>, she soon became
as gentle as a lamb. She died about a year after
entering the Convent, but she retained her deep religious
convictions to the last. She is buried beneath the sanctuary
in the chapel of the Georgetown Convent. In connection
with her a few lines often come to my mind which
seem so appropriate that I can not deny myself the pleasure
of quoting them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She was so fair that in the Angelic choir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She will not need put on another shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than that she bore on earth.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have heard it stated that during Virginia Scott's residence
in Paris there existed a deep attachment between
herself and a young gentleman of foreign birth. The
story goes that in the course of time he became as devoted
to his religion as he had hitherto been to the beautiful
American, and that it was agreed between them that
they should both consecrate themselves thereafter to the
service of God. He accordingly entered at once upon a
religious life. I have heard that they afterwards met at
a service before the altar, but that there was no recognition.
As intimate as I became with the members of the
Scott family in subsequent years, I never heard any allusion
to this incident in their family history, and I can
readily understand that it was a subject upon which they
were too sensitive to dwell.</p>

<p>Father Connelly, whom I have mentioned in connection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
with Miss Scott's conversion, began his career as an Episcopal
clergyman. There was a barrier to his becoming a
Roman Catholic priest, as he was married; but his wife
soon shared in his religious ardor, and when he entered
the priesthood she became a nun. He lacked stability,
however, in his religious views, and was subsequently received
again into the Episcopal Church. It was his desire
that his wife should at once join him but she refused
to leave the Convent, and she finally became the founder
of the Order of the "Sisters of the Holy Child." I have
heard that he took legal measures to obtain possession of
her, but if so he was unsuccessful in his efforts.</p>

<p>Another one of Madame Chegaray's distinguished
pupils was Martha Pierce of Louisville. As she attended
this school some years before I entered, I knew of her in
these days only by reputation. But some years later I
had the pleasure of knowing her quite intimately, when
she talked very freely with me in regard to her eventful
life. She told me that upon a certain occasion in the
days when women rarely traveled alone she was returning
to Kentucky under the care of Henry Clay, and
stopped in Washington long enough to visit the Capitol.
Upon its steps she was introduced to Robert Craig Stanard
of Richmond, upon whom she apparently made a deep
impression, for one year later the handsome young Southerner
carried the Kentucky girl, at the age of sixteen,
back to Virginia as his bride. During her long life in
Richmond her home, now the Westmoreland Club, was a
notable <i>salon</i>, where the <i>beaux esprits</i> of the South gathered.
She survived Mr. Stanard many years. Beautiful,
even in old age, gifted and cultivated, her attractions of
face and intellect paled before her inexpressible charm
of manner. She traveled much abroad and especially in
England. A prominent Kentuckian once told me that he
heard Washington Irving say that Mrs. Stanard received
more attention and admiration in the highest circles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
English society than any other American woman he had
ever known. She corresponded for many years with
Thackeray, the Duke of Wellington and many other
prominent Englishmen, and in her own country was
equally distinguished. In the course of one of our numerous
conversations she told me that after the death of
Edward Everett she loaned his biographer the letters she
had received from that distinguished orator. During the
latter part of her life she gave up her house in Richmond
and came to Washington to reside, where she remained
until the end of her life. She left no descendants. Her
husband's mother, Jane Stith Craig, daughter of Adam
Craig of Richmond, was immortalized by Edgar Allan
Poe, who, fictitiously naming her "Helen," paid feeling
tribute to her charms in those beautiful verses commencing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Helen, thy beauty is to me<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like those Nicean barks of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The weary, way-worn wanderer bore<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To his own native shore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among my other schoolmates at Madame Chegaray's
were Susan Maria Clarkson de Peyster, a daughter of
James Ferguson de Peyster, who subsequently married
Robert Edward Livingston; Margaret Masters, a daughter
of Judge Josiah Masters of Troy, New York, and the
wife of John W. King; Virginia Beverly Wood, a daughter
of Silas Wood of New York, who became the wife of
John Leverett Rogers; and Elizabeth MacNiel, daughter
of General John MacNiel of the Army and wife of General
Henry W. Benham of the U.S. Engineer Corps.</p>

<p>After a number of years spent in teaching, Madame
Chegaray gave up her New York school and moved to
Madison, New Jersey (at one time called Bottle Hill),
with the intention of spending the remainder of her life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in retirement; but she was doomed to disappointment.
Discovering almost immediately that through a relative
her affairs had become deeply involved, she with undaunted
courage at once opened a school in Madison in
the house which she had purchased with the view of
spending there the declining years of her life. Previous
to this time I had been one of her day scholars; I entered
the second school as a boarding pupil. Once a week we
were driven three miles to Morristown to attend church.
I recall an amusing incident connected with this weekly
visit to that place. One Sunday a fellow boarder, thinking
that perhaps she might find some leisure before the
service to perfect herself in her lesson for the following
day, thoughtlessly took along with her a volume of French
plays by Voltaire. During the service someone in a near
pew observed the author's name upon the book, and forthwith
the Morristown populace was startled to hear that
among Madame Chegaray's pupils was a follower of the
noted infidel. It took some time to convince the public
that this book was carried to church by my schoolmate
without her teacher's knowledge; and the girl was horrified
to learn that she was unintentionally to blame for a
new local scandal. While I was at Madame Chegaray's
I owned a schoolbook entitled "Shelley, Coleridge and
Keats." I brought it home with me one day, but my
father took it away from me and, as I learned later, burned
it, owing to his detestation of Shelley's moral character.
On one occasion he quoted in court some extracts from
Shelley as illustrative of the poet's character, but I cannot
recall the passage.</p>

<p>After two years spent in Madison, Madame Chegaray
returned to New York and reopened her school on the
corner of Union Square and Fifteenth Street in three
houses built for her by Samuel B. Ruggles. At that time
the omnibuses had been running only to Fourteenth
Street, but, out of courtesy to this noble woman, their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
route was extended to Fifteenth Street, where a lamp for
the same reason was placed by the city. Madame Chegaray
taught here for many years, but finally moved to 78
Madison Avenue, where she remained until, on account of
old age, she was obliged to give up her teaching.</p>

<p>While I was still attending Madame Chegaray's school,
my father, under the impression that I was not quite as
proficient in mathematics and astronomy as it was his desire
and ambition that I should be, employed Professor
Robert Adrian of Columbia College to give me private instruction
in my own home. Under his able tuition, I particularly
enjoyed traversing the firmament. I was always
faithful to the planet Venus, whose beauty was to me then,
as now, a constant delight. In those youthful days my
proprietorship in this heavenly body seemed to me as well
established as in a Fifth Avenue lot, and was quite as tangible.
I regarded myself in the light of an individual
proprietor, and, like Alexander Selkirk in his far away
island of the sea, my right to this celestial domain there
was none to dispute.</p>

<p>After the flight of so many years, and in view, also, of
the fact that sometimes the world seems to us older women
to be almost turned upside down, it may not be uninteresting
to speak of some of the books which were familiar
to me during my school days. One of the first I
ever read was "Clarissa Harlowe" by Samuel Richardson.
"Cecilia," by Frances Burney, was another well-known
book of the day. Mrs. Amelia Opie was also a
popular authoress, and her novel entitled "White Lies"
should, in my opinion, grace every library. Miss Maria
Edgeworth and Mrs. Ann Eliza Bray, the latter of whom
so graphically depicted the higher phases of English life,
were popular authoresses in my earlier days in New
York. Many years later some of the books I have mentioned
were republished by the Harpers. "Gil Blas,"
whose author, Le Sage, was the skilful delineator of hu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>man
nature, its attributes and its frailties, was much
read, and, in my long journey through life, certain portions
of this book have often been recalled to me by my
many and varied experiences. I must not fail to speak
of the "Children of the Abbey," by Regina M. Roche,
where the fascinations of Lord Leicester are so vividly
portrayed; nor of another book entitled "The Three
Spaniards," by George Walker, which used to strike terror
to my unsophisticated soul.</p>

<p>When Madame Chegaray retired temporarily from her
school life and moved to Madison in New Jersey, Charles
Canda, who had taught drawing for her, established a
school of his own in New York which became very prominent.
He had an attractive young daughter, who met
with a most heartrending end. On her way to a ball, in
company with one of her girl friends, Charlotte Canda
was thrown from her carriage, and when picked up her
life was extinct. As there were no injuries found upon
her body, it was generally supposed that the shock brought
on an attack of heart-failure. Subsequently the disconsolate
parents ordered from Italy a monument costing a
fabulous sum of money for those days, which was placed
over the grave of their only daughter in Greenwood Cemetery,
where it still continues to command the admiration
of sightseers. This tragic incident occurred in February,
1845, on the eve of the victim's seventeenth
birthday.</p>

<p>While Madame Chegaray was my teacher there was a
charming French society in New York, her house being
the rendezvous of this interesting social circle. I recall
with much pleasure the names of Boisseau, Trudeau,
Boisaubin, Thebaud and Brugiere. Madame Chegaray's
sister, Caroline, together with her husband, Charles B&eacute;rault,
who taught dancing, and their three daughters,
resided with her. The oldest, Madame Vincente Rose
Am&eacute;line (Madame George R. A. Chaulet), taught music<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for her aunt; the second niece, Marie-Louise Jos&eacute;phine
Laure, married Joseph U. F. d'Hervilly, a Frenchman,
and in after life established a school in Philadelphia
which she named Chegaray Institute; while the youngest,
Pauline, married a gentleman from Cuba, named de Ruiz,
and now resides in Paris.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>LIFE AND EXPERIENCES IN THE METROPOLIS</h3>


<p>My health was somewhat impaired by an attack
of chills and fever while I was still a pupil
at Madame Chegaray's school. Long Island was
especially affected with this malady, and even certain locations
on the Hudson were on this account regarded with
disfavor. In subsequent years, when the building operations
of the Hudson River railroad cut off the water in
many places and formed stagnant pools, it became much
worse. As I began to convalesce, Dr. John W. Francis
prescribed a change of air, and I was accordingly sent to
Saratoga to be under the care of my friend, Mrs. Richard
Armistead of North Carolina. A few days after my arrival
we were joined by Mrs. De Witt Clinton and her attractive
step-daughter, Julia Clinton. The United States
Hotel, where we stayed, was thronged with visitors, but as
I was only a young girl my observation of social life was
naturally limited and I knew but few persons. Mrs. Clinton
was a granddaughter of Philip Livingston, the Signer,
and married at a mature age. She had a natural and
most profound admiration for the memory of her illustrious
husband, whom I have heard her describe as "a prince
among men," and she cherished an undying resentment
for any of his political antagonists.</p>

<p>While we were still at the United States Hotel, Martin
Van Buren, at that time President of the United States,
arrived in Saratoga and sojourned at the same hotel with
us. His visit made an indelible impression upon my memory
owing to a highly sensational incident. During the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
evening of the President's arrival Mrs. Clinton was
promenading in the large parlor of the hotel, leaning upon
the arm of the Portuguese <i>Charg&eacute; d'Affaires</i>, Senhor Joaquim
Cesar de Figani&egrave;re, when Mr. Van Buren espying
her advanced with his usual suavity of manner to meet
her. With a smile upon his face, he extended his hand,
whereupon Mrs. Clinton immediately turned her back and
compelled her escort to imitate her, apparently ignoring
the fact that he was a foreign diplomat and that his
conduct might subsequently be resented by the authorities
in Washington. This incident, occurring as it did in
a crowded room, was observed by many of the guests and
naturally created much comment. In talking over the incident
the next day Mrs. Clinton told me she was under
the impression that Mr. Van Buren clearly understood her
feelings in regard to him, as some years previous, when
he and General Andrew Jackson called upon her together,
she had declined to see him, although Jackson had been
admitted. This act was characteristic of the woman. It
was the expression of a resentment which she had harbored
against Mr. Van Buren for years and which she was only
abiding her time to display. I was standing at Mrs. Clinton's
side during this dramatic episode, and to my youthful
fancy she seemed, indeed, a heroine!</p>

<p>Mrs. Clinton was a social leader in Gotham before the
days of the <i>nouveaux riches</i>, and her sway was that of an
autocrat. Her presence was in every way imposing. She
possessed many charming characteristics and was in more
respects than one an uncrowned queen, retaining her wonderful
tact and social power until the day of her death.
I love to dwell upon Mrs. Clinton because, apart from her
remarkable personal characteristics, she was the friend of
my earlier life. Possessed as she was of many eccentricities,
her excellencies far counterbalanced them. Of the
latter, I recall especially the unusual ability and care she
displayed in housekeeping, which at that time was regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
as an accomplishment in which every woman took particular
pride. To be still more specific, she apparently had
a much greater horror of dirt than the average housewife,
and carried her antipathy to such an extent that she tolerated
but few fires in her University Place establishment
in New York, as she seriously objected to the uncleanness
caused by the dust and ashes! No matter how cold her
house nor how frigid the day, she never seemed to suffer
but, on the contrary, complained that her home was overheated.
Her guests frequently commented upon "the nipping
and eager air" which Shakespeare's Horatio speaks
of, but it made no apparent impression upon their hostess.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clinton's articulation was affected by a slight stammer,
which, in my opinion, but added piquancy to her
epigrammatic sayings. She once remarked to me, "I shall
never be c-c-cold until I'm dead." An impulse took possession
of me which somehow, in spite of the great difference
in our ages, I seemed unable to resist, and I retorted,
"We are not all assured of our temperatures at that period."
She regarded me for a few moments with unfeigned
astonishment, but said nothing. I did not suffer for my
temerity at that moment, but later I was chagrined to
learn she had remarked that I was the most impertinent
girl she had ever known. I remember that upon another
occasion she told me that one of Governor Clinton's grandchildren,
Augusta Clinton, was about to leave school at a
very early age. "Doesn't she intend to finish her education?"
I inquired. "No," was the quick and emphatic
but stuttering reply, "she's had sufficient education. I
was at school only two months, and I'm sure I'm smart
enough." Her niece, Margaret Gelston, who was present
and was remarkable for her clear wits, retorted: "Only
think how much smarter you'd have been if you had remained
longer." In an angry tone Mrs. Clinton replied,
"I don't want to be any smarter, I'm smart enough."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clinton's two nieces, the Misses Mary and Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>garet
Gelston, were among my earliest and most intimate
friends. They occupied a prominent social position in
New York and both were well known for their unusual
intellectuality. They were daughters of Maltby Gelston,
President of the Manhattan Bank, and granddaughters of
David Gelston, who was appointed Collector of the Port
of New York by Jefferson and retained that position for
twenty years. Late in life Mary Gelston married Henry
R. Winthrop of New York. She died a few years ago
leaving an immense estate to Princeton Theological Seminary.
"I pray," reads her will, "that the Trustees of
this Institution may make such use of this bequest as that
the extension of the Church of Christ on earth and the
glory of God may be promoted thereby." In the same
instrument she adds: "As a similar bequest would have
been made by my deceased sister, Margaret L. Gelston,
had she survived me, I desire that the said Trustees
should regard it as given jointly by my said sister and
by me." Some distant relatives, thinking that her money
could be more satisfactorily employed than in the manner
indicated, contested the will, and the Seminary finally received,
as the result of a compromise, between $1,600,000
and $1,700,000.</p>

<p>One of my earliest recollections is of John Jacob Astor,
a feeble old man descending the doorsteps of his home
on Broadway near Houston Street to enter his carriage.
His house was exceedingly plain and was one of a row
owned by him. His son, William Backhouse Astor, who
married a daughter of General John Armstrong, Secretary
of War under President Madison, during at least a portion
of his father's life lived in a fine house on Lafayette
Place. I have attended evening parties there that were
exceedingly simple in character, and at which Mrs. Astor
was always plainly dressed and wore no jewels. I have
a very distinct recollection of one of these parties owing
to a ludicrous incident connected with myself. My mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
was a woman of decidedly domestic tastes, whose whole
life was so immersed in her large family of children that
she never allowed an event of a social character to interfere
with what she regarded as her household or maternal
duties. We older children were therefore much thrown
upon our own resources from a social point of view, and
when I grew into womanhood and entered society I was
usually accompanied to entertainments by my father.
Sometimes, however, I went with my lifelong friend, Margaret
Tillotson Kemble, a daughter of William Kemble,
of whom I shall speak hereafter. Upon this particular
occasion I had gone early in the day to the Kembles preparatory
to spending the night there, with the intention
of attending a ball at the Astors'. Having dined, supped,
and dressed myself for the occasion, in company with
Miss Kemble and her father I reached the Astor residence,
where I found on the doorstep an Irish maid from my
own home awaiting my arrival. In her hand she held an
exquisite bouquet of pink and white japonicas which had
been sent to me by John Still Winthrop, the <i>fianc&eacute;</i> of
Susan Armistead, another of my intimate friends. The
bouquet had arrived just after my departure from home
and, quite unknown to my family, the Irish maid out of
the goodness of her heart had taken it upon herself to see
that it was placed in my hands. I learned later that,
much to the amusement of many of the guests, she had
been awaiting my arrival for several hours. It seems
almost needless to add that I carried my flowers throughout
the evening with much girlish pride and pleasure.</p>

<p>Among the guests at this ball was Mrs. Francis R.
Boreel, the young and beautiful daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Walter Langdon, who wore in her dark hair a diamond
necklace, a recent gift from her grandfather, John Jacob
Astor. It was currently rumored at the time that it cost
twenty thousand dollars, which was then a very large
amount to invest in a single article of that character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Mrs. Langdon's two other daughters were Mrs. Matthew
Wilks, who married abroad and spent her life there, and
the first Mrs. De Lancey Kane, who made a runaway
match, and both of whom left descendants in New York.
All three women were celebrated for their beauty, but Mrs.
Boreel was usually regarded as the handsomest of the
trio. Mrs. Walter Langdon was Dorothea Astor, a daughter
of John Jacob Astor, and her husband was a grandson
of Judge John Langdon of New Hampshire, who
equipped Stark's regiment for the battle of Bennington,
and who for twelve years was a member of the United
States Senate and was present as President <i>pro tempore</i>
of that body at the first inauguration of Washington.</p>

<p>Another society woman whose presence at this ball I
recall, and without whom no entertainment was regarded
as complete, was Mrs. Charles Augustus Davis, wife of the
author of the well-known "Jack Downing Letters." Indeed,
the name "Jack Downing" seemed so much a part
of the Davis family that in after years I have often heard
Mrs. Davis called "Mrs. Jack Downing." The Davises
had a handsome daughter who married a gentleman of
French descent, but neither of them long survived the
marriage.</p>

<p>In an old newspaper of 1807 I came across the following
marriage notice, which was the first Astor wedding to
occur in this country:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Bentzon&mdash;Astor.</span> Married, on Monday morning, the
14th ult. [September], by the Rev. Mr. [Ralph] Williston,
Adrian B. Bentzon, Esq., of the Isle of St. Croix, to Miss
Magdalen Astor, daughter of John Jacob Astor of this
city.</p></div>

<p>It was while on a cruise among the West Indies that
Miss Astor met Mr. Bentzon, a Danish gentleman of good
family but moderate fortune. In the early part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
last century many ambitious foreigners went to that part
of the world with the intention of making their fortunes.</p>

<p>Another daughter of John Jacob Astor, Eliza, married
Count Vincent Rumpff, who was for some years Minister
at the Court of the Tuileries from the Hanseatic towns
of Germany. She was well known through life, and long
remembered after death, for her symmetrical Christian
character. One of her writings, entitled "Transplanted
Flowers," has been published in conjunction with one of
the Duchesse de Broglie, daughter of Madame de Sta&euml;l,
with whom she was intimately associated in her Christian
works.</p>

<p>Henry Astor, the brother of John Jacob Astor, was the
first of the family to come to America. I am able to state,
upon the authority of the late Rev. Dr. Morgan Dix, rector
of Trinity church in New York, and a life-long friend
of the whole Astor connection, that he was a private in a
Hessian regiment that fought against our colonies in the
Revolutionary War. After its close he decided to remain
in New York where he entered the employment of a butcher
in the old Oswego market. He subsequently embarked
upon more ambitious enterprises, became a highly successful
business man and at his death left a large fortune to
his childless widow. Dr. Dix has stated that it was probably
through him that the younger brother came to this
country. However this may be, John Jacob Astor sailed
for America as a steerage passenger in a ship commanded
by Capt. Jacob Stout and arrived in Baltimore in January,
1784. He subsequently went to New York, where he
spent his first night in the house of George Dieterich, a
fellow countryman whom he had known in Germany and
by whom he was now employed to peddle cakes. After
remaining in his employ for a time and accumulating a
little money he hired a store of his own where he sold
toys and German knickknacks. He afterwards added<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
skins and even musical instruments to his stock in trade,
as will appear from the following in <i>The Daily Advertiser</i>
of New York, of the 2d of January, 1789, and following
issues:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p class='adcenter'>J. Jacob Astor,<br />
At No. 81, Queen-street,<br />
Next door but one to the Friends Meeting-House,<br />
Has for sale an assortment of<br />
Piano fortes, of the newest construction,</p>
<p class='adleft'>Made by the best makers in London, which he will sell on<br />
reasonable terms.<br />
He gives Cash for all kinds of FURS:<br />
And has for sale a quantity of Canada Beaver, and<br />
Beaver Coating, Racoon Skins, and Racoon Blankets,<br />
Muskrat Skins, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>It would seem that these Astor pianos were manufactured
in London and that George Astor, an elder
brother of John Jacob Astor, was associated with the
latter in their sale. Indeed, one of them, formerly
owned by the Clinton family and now in Washington's
Headquarters in Newburgh, bears the name of "Geo.
Astor &amp; Co., Cornhill, London;" while still another in
my immediate neighborhood in Washington has the inscription
of "Astor and Camp, 79 Cornhill, London."
Their octaves were few in number, and a pupil of Chopin
would have regarded them with scorn; but upon these
little spindle-legged affairs a duet could be performed.
My first knowledge of instrumental music was derived
from one of these pianos, and among the earliest recollections
of my childhood is that of hearing my three maiden
aunts, my father's sisters, playing in turn the inspiring
Scotch airs upon the Astor piano that stood in their
drawing-room. One of their songs was especially inimical
to cloistered life and it, too, was possibly of Scotch origin.
I am unable to recall its exact words, but its refrain ran
as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I will not be a nun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can not be a nun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall not be a nun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm so fond of pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll not be a nun.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I own an original letter written by John Jacob Astor
from New York on the 26th of April, 1826, addressed to
ex-President James Monroe, my husband's grandfather,
which I regard as interesting on account of its quaint
style:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Permit me to congratulate you on your Honourable retirement
[from public life] for which I most sincerely
wish you may enjoy that Peace and Tranquility to which
you are so justly entitled.</p>

<p>Without wishing to cause you any Inconveniency [sic]
on account of the loan which I so long since made to you
I would be glad if you would put it in a train of sittlelment
[sic] if not the whole let it be a part with the interest
Due.</p>

<p>I hope Dear Sir that you and Mrs. Monroe enjoy the
best of health and that you may live many years to wittness
[sic] the Prosperity of the country to which you have
so generously contributed.</p>

<p>I am most Respectfully Dear Sir your obed S. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">J. J. Astor.</span></p>

<p>The Honble James Monroe.</p></div>

<p>It may here be stated that Mr. Astor's solicitude concerning
Mr. Monroe's financial obligation was duly relieved,
and that the debt was paid in full.</p>

<p>John Jacob Astor's numerous descendants can lay this
"flattering unction" to their souls, that every dollar of his
vast wealth was accumulated through thrift while leading
an upright life.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned stage coach in my early days ran between
New York and Harlem, but the fashionable drive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
was on the west side of the city along what was then called
the "Bloomingdale Road." Many fashionable New Yorkers
owned and occupied handsome country seats along this
route, and closed their city homes for a period during the
heated term. I recall with pleasure the home of the Prussian
Consul General and Mrs. John William Schmidt, and
especially their attractive daughters. Mr. Schmidt, who
came to this country as a bachelor, married Miss Eliza
Ann Bache of New York. Quite a number of years subsequent
to this event, before they had children of their
own, they adopted a little girl whom they named Julia and
whom I knew very well in my early girlhood. As equestrian
exercise was popular in New York at that time, many
of the young men and women riding on the Bloomingdale
Road would stop at the Schmidts' hospitable home, rest
their horses and enjoy a pleasing half-hour's conversation
with the daughters of the household. Among the fair
riders was Mary Tallmadge, a famous beauty and a daughter
of General James Tallmadge. During her early life
and at a period when visits abroad were few and far between,
her father accompanied her to Europe. During
her travels on the continent she visited St. Petersburg,
where her beauty created a great sensation. While there
the Emperor Nicholas I. presented her with a handsome
India shawl. She returned to America, married
Philip S. Van Rensselaer, a son of the old Patroon,
and lived for many years on Washington Square in
New York.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton and family also owned and occupied
a house in this charming suburb called "The
Grange." It was subsequently occupied by Herman
Thorne, who had married Miss Jane Mary Jauncey, a
wealthy heiress of New York. He lived in this house
only a few years when he went with his wife to reside in
Paris during the reign of Louis Philippe. Mr. Thorne
became the most prominent American resident there and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
excited the envy of many of his countrymen by his lavish
expenditure of money. His daughters made foreign
matrimonial alliances. He was originally from Schenectady,
for a time was a purser in the U.S. Navy, and was
remarkable for his handsome presence and courtly
bearing.</p>

<p>Jacob Lorillard lived in a handsome house in Manhattanville,
a short distance from the Bloomingdale Road.
He began life, first as an apprentice and then as a proprietor,
in the tanning and hide business, and his tannery
was on Pearl Street. He then, with his brothers, embarked
in the manufacture and sale of snuff and tobacco,
in which, as is well known, he amassed an immense fortune.
My earliest recollection of the family is in the days
of its great prosperity. One of Mr. Lorillard's daughters,
Julia, who married Daniel Edgar, I knew very well,
and I recall a visit I once made her in her beautiful home,
where I also attended her wedding a few years later. At
this time her mother was a widow, and shortly after the
marriage the place was sold to the Catholic order of the
<i>Sacre Coeur</i>. Mrs. Jacob Lorillard was a daughter of the
Rev. Doctor Johann Christoff Kunze, professor of Oriental
Languages in Columbia College.</p>

<p>Many years ago the wags of London exhausted their
wits in fittingly characterizing and ridiculing the numerous
equipages of a London manufacturer of snuff and tobacco.
One couplet suggestive of the manner in which
this vast wealth was acquired, was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who would have thought it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Noses had bought it.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The suitor of the daughter of this wealthy Englishman
was appropriately dubbed "Up to Snuff." Alas,
this ancestral and aristocratic luxury of snuff departed
many years ago, but succeeding generations have been
"up to snuff" in many other ways. The gold snuff-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>box
frequently studded with gems which I remember so
well in days gone by and especially at the home Gouverneur
Kemble in Cold Spring, where it was passed
around and freely used by both men and women, now
commands no respect except as an ancestral curio. Dryden,
Dean Swift, Pope, Addison, Lord Chesterfield, Dr.
Johnson, Garrick, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Keats, Charles
Lamb, Gibbon, Walter Scott and Darwin were among the
prominent worshipers of the snuff-box and its contents,
while some of them indulged in the habit to the degree of
intemperance. In describing his manner of using the
snuff-box Gibbon wrote: "I drew my snuff-box, rapped it,
took snuff twice, and continued my discourse in my usual
attitude of my body bent forwards, and my fore-finger
stretched out;" and Boswell wrote in its praise:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, snuff! our fashionable end and aim&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strasburgh, Rappe, Dutch, Scotch&mdash;whate'er thy name!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Powder celestial! quintessence divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New joys entrance my soul while thou art mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who takes? who takes thee not? Where'er I range<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I smell thy sweets from Pall Mall to the 'Change.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While the spirit of patriotism was as prevalent in early
New York as it is now, it seems to me that it was somewhat
less demonstrative. The 4th of July, however, was
anticipated by the youngsters of the day with the greatest
eagerness and pleasure. It was the habit of my father,
for many years, to take us children early in the morning
to the City Hall to attend the official observances of the
day, an experience which we naturally regarded as a great
privilege. Booths were temporarily erected all along the
pavement in front of the City Hall, where substantial
food was displayed and sold to the crowds collected to assist
in celebrating the day. About noon several military
companies arrived upon the scene and took their positions
in the park, where, after a number of interesting man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>euvers,
a salute was fired which was terrifying to my
youthful nerves. Small boys, then as now, provided themselves
with pistols, and human life was occasionally sacrificed
to patriotic ardor, although I never remember hearing
of cases of lockjaw resulting from such accidents, as
is so frequently the case at present. Firecrackers and
torpedoes were then in vogue, but skyrockets and more
elaborate fireworks had not then come into general use.
I do not recall that the national flag was especially prominent
upon the "glorious fourth," and it is my impression
that this insignia of patriotism was not universally displayed
upon patriotic occasions until the Civil War.</p>

<p>The musical world of New York lay dormant until about
the year 1825, when Dominick Lynch, much to the delight
of the cultivated classes, introduced the Italian
Opera. Through his instrumentality Madame Malibran,
her father, Signor Garcia, and her brother, Manuel Garcia,
who by the way died abroad in 1906, nearly ninety-nine
years of age, came to this country and remained for quite
a period. I have heard many sad traditions regarding
Malibran, whose name is certainly immortal in the annals
of the musical world. Mr. Lynch was the social leader
of his day in New York, was &aelig;sthetic in his tastes, and possessed
a highly cultivated voice. He frequently sang the
beautiful old ballads so much in vogue at that period. I
have heard through Mrs. Samuel L. Hinckley, an old friend
of mine, who remembered the incident, that during a visit
to Boston when he sang Tom Moore's pathetic ballad,
"Oft in the Stilly Night," there was scarcely a dry eye
in the room. In referring to the introduction of the Italian
Opera into this country Dr. John W. Francis in his
"Old New York" thus speaks of Dominick Lynch: "For
this advantageous accession to the resources of mental
gratification, we were indebted to the taste and refinement
of Dominick Lynch, the liberality of the manager of the
Park Theater, Stephen Price, and the distinguished rep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>utation
of the Venetian, Lorenzo Da Ponte. Lynch, a
native of New York, was the acknowledged head of the
fashionable and festive board, a gentleman of the ton
and a melodist of great powers and of exquisite taste; he
had long striven to enhance the character of our music;
he was the master of English song, but he felt, from his
close cultivation of music and his knowledge of the genius
of his countrymen, that much was wanting, and that more
could be accomplished, and he sought out, while in Europe,
an Italian <i>troupe</i>, which his persuasive eloquence
and the liberal spirit of Price led to embark for our shores
where they arrived in November, 1825." Stephen Price
here referred to by Dr. Francis was the manager of the
old Park Theater. Dominick Lynch's grandson, Nicholas
Luquer, who with his charming wife, formerly Miss Helen
K. Shelton of New York, resides in Washington, and his
son, Lynch Luquer, inherit the musical ability of their
ancestor.</p>

<p>The great actors of the day performed in the Park Theater.
I also vividly remember the Bowery Theater, as well
as in subsequent years Burton's Theater in Chambers
Street and the Astor Place Theater. When William C.
Macready, the great English actor, was performing in the
latter in 1849 a riot occurred caused by the jealousy existing
between him and his American rival, Edwin Forrest.
Forrest had not been well received in England owing, as
he believed, to the unfriendly influence of Macready.
While the latter was considered by many the better actor,
Forrest was exceptionally popular with a certain class of
people in New York whose sympathies were easily enlisted
and whose passions were readily aroused. During the evening
referred to, while Macready was acting in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
Macbeth, a determined mob attacked the theater, and the
riot was not quelled until after a bitter struggle, in which
the police and the military were engaged, and during
which twenty-one were killed and thirty-three wounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>In consequence of this unfortunate rivalry and its
bloody results, Forrest became morbid, and his domestic
infelicities that followed served to still further embitter
his life. In 1850 his wife instituted proceedings for divorce
in the Superior Court of the City of New York, and
the trial was protracted for two years. She was represented
by the eminent jurist, Charles O'Conor, while Forrest
employed "Prince" John Van Buren, son of the ex-President.
The legal struggle was one of the most celebrated
in the annals of the New York bar. There was
abundant evidence of moral delinquency on the part of
both parties to the suit, but the verdict was in favor of
Mrs. Forrest. She was the daughter of John Sinclair,
formerly a drummer in the English army and subsequently
a professional singer. James Gordon Bennett said of her
in the <i>Herald</i> that "being born and schooled in turmoil
and dissipation and reared in constant excitement she
could not live without it."</p>

<p>I have heard it said that one day John Van Buren was
asked by a disgruntled friend at the close of a hotly contested
suit whether there was any case so vile or disreputable
that he would refuse to act as counsel for the
accused. The quick response was: "I must first know the
circumstances of the case; but what have you been doing?"
Dr. Valentine Mott, who for many years was a
resident of Paris, gave a fancy-dress ball in New York in
honor of the Prince de Joinville, son of Louis Philippe.
At this entertainment John Van Buren appeared in the
usual evening dress with a red sash tied around his waist.
Much to the amusement of the guests whom he met, his
salutation was: "Would you know me?" It will be remembered
that he was familiarly called "Prince John,"
owing to the fact that he had once danced with Queen Victoria
prior to her ascension to the throne. One day Van
Buren met on the street James T. Brady, a lawyer of
equal ability and wit, who had recently returned from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
visit to England. In a most patronizing manner he inquired
whether he had seen the Queen. "Certainly,"
said Mr. Brady, "and under these circumstances. I was
walking along the street when by chance the Queen's carriage
overtook me, and the moment Her Majesty's eye
lighted upon me she exclaimed: 'Hello, Jim Brady, when
did you hear from John Van Buren?'" I recall another
amusing anecdote about John Van Buren during my school
days. Mustaches were at that time worn chiefly by the
sporting element. Mr. Van Buren, who was very attentive
to Catharine Theodora Duer, a daughter of President William
Alexander Duer of Columbia College, and who, by
the way, never married, adopted this style of facial adornment,
but the young woman objecting to it he cut it off
and sent it to her in a letter. Prince John Van Buren's
daughter, Miss Anna Vander Poel Van Buren, many
years thereafter, married Edward Alexander Duer, a
nephew of this Catharine Theodora Duer.</p>

<p>It was my very great pleasure to know Fanny Kemble
and her father, Charles Kemble. She was, indeed, the
queen of tragedy, and delighted the histrionic world of
New York by her remarkable rendering of the plays of
Shakespeare. In later years when I heard her give
Shakespearian readings, I regarded the occasion as an epoch
in my life. In this connection I venture to express my
surprise that the classical English quotations so pleasing
to the ear in former days are now so seldom heard. It
seems unfortunate that the epigrammatic sentences, for
example, of grand old Dr. Samuel Johnson have become
almost obsolete. In former years Byron appealed to the
sentiment, while the more ambitious quoted Greek
maxims. The sayings of the old authors were recalled,
mingled with the current topics of the day. It would
seem, however, that the present generation is decidedly
more interested in quotations from the stock exchange.
Edmund Burke said that "the age of chivalry is gone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that of sophists, economists, and calculators has succeeded."</p>

<p>Upon her return to England Fanny Kemble published
her journal kept while in the United States, which was
by no means pleasing in every respect to her American
readers. It is said that in one of her literary effusions
she dwelt upon a custom, which she claimed was prevalent
in America, of parents naming their children after classical
heroes, and gave as an example a child in New York who
bore the name of Alfonzo Alonzo Agamemnon Dionysius
Bogardus. The sister of this youth, she stated, was named
Clementina Seraphina Imogen. I think this statement
must have been evolved from her own brain, as it would
be difficult to conceive of parents who would consent to
make their children notorious in such a ridiculous manner.
Fanny Kemble married Pierce Butler, a lawyer of
ability and cousin of the U.S. Senator from South Carolina
of the same name, and they were divorced in 1849,
when the Hon. George M. Dallas was counsel for Fanny
Kemble and Rufus Choate appeared for her husband.</p>

<p>Fanny Elssler, a queen of grace and beauty on the
stage, delighted immense audiences at the Park Theater.
She came to this country under the auspices of Chevalier
Henry Wikoff, a roving but accomplished soldier of fortune,
who pitched his camp in both continents. Upon her
arrival in New York the "divine Fanny," as she was invariably
called, was borne to her destination in a carriage
from which the horses had been detached by her enthusiastic
<i>adorateurs</i>, led by August Belmont. She was, indeed,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A being so fair that the same lips and eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bore on earth might serve in Paradise.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At this distant day it seems almost impossible to describe
her. She seemed to float upon the stage sustained
only by the surrounding atmosphere. In my opinion she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
has never had a rival, with the possible exception of Taglioni,
the great Swedish <i>danseuse</i>. I saw Fanny Elssler
dance the <i>cracovienne</i> and the <i>cachucha</i>, and it is a memory
which will linger with me always. The music that
accompanied these dances was generally selected from the
popular airs of the day. Many dark stories were afloat
concerning Fanny Elssler's private life, but to me it
seems impossible to associate her angelic presence with
anything but her wonderful art. She was never received
socially in New York; indeed, the only person that I remember
connected with the stage in my early days who
had the social <i>entr&eacute;e</i> was Fanny Kemble.</p>

<p>We attended the Dutch Reformed Church in New York
of which the Rev. Dr. Jacob Brodhead was for many
years the pastor. My aunts, however, attended one of the
three collegiate churches in the lower part of the city, and
I sometimes accompanied them and, as there was a frequent
interchange of pulpits, I became quite accustomed
to hear all of the three clergymen. The Rev. Dr. John
Knox, who endeared himself to his flock by his gentle and
appealing ministrations; the Rev. Dr. Thomas De Witt, a
profound theologian and courtly gentleman; and the Rev.
Dr. William C. Brownlee, with his vigorous Scotch accent,
preaching against what he invariably called "papery"
(popery), and recalling, as he did, John Knox of
old, that irritating thorn in the side of the unfortunate
Mary Queen of Scots, made up this remarkable trio. During
the latter part of his life Dr. Brownlee suffered from
a stroke of paralysis which rendered him speechless, and
his Catholic adversaries improved this opportunity to circulate
the report that he had been visited by a judgment
from Heaven.</p>

<p>There were many shining lights in the Episcopal Church
at this time in New York. The Rev. Dr. William Berrian
was the acceptable rector of St. John's, which was then
as now a chapel of Trinity Parish. The Rev. Dr. Francis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
L. Hawks was the popular rector of St. Thomas's church,
on the corner of Broadway and Houston Streets. He was
a North Carolinian by birth, but is said to have been in
part of Indian descent. I recall with pleasure his masterly
rendition of the Episcopal service. During the Civil
War he made it quite apparent to his parishioners that
his sympathies were with the South, and as most of them
did not share his views he moved to Baltimore, where a
more congenial atmosphere surrounded him.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Stephen H. Tyng, senior, was the rector
of St. George's Episcopal church in the lower part of the
city. He was a theologian of the Low-Church school and
was greatly esteemed by all of his colleagues. His son,
the Rev. Dr. Stephen H. Tyng, junior, was in full sympathy
with the Low-Church views of his father, and will
be recalled as an evangelical preacher of exceptional power
and wide influence. In the summer of 1867 he preached,
in defiance of the canons of the Episcopal Church, in St.
James's Methodist church in New Brunswick, N.J., thus
invading without authority the parishes of the Rev. Dr.
Alfred Stubs and the Rev. Dr. Edward B. Boggs of that
city. His trial was of sensational interest, and resulted,
as will be remembered, in his conviction. The attitude
of the Tyngs, father and son, was humorously described
by Anthony Bleecker, a well-known wit of the day, in
these verses:</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Orville Dewey, renowned for his intellectual
attainments, preached in the Unitarian church in
Mercer Street. In subsequent years his sermons were published
and I understand are still read with much interest
and pleasure. Archbishop John Hughes, whom I knew
quite well, was the controlling power in the Roman Catholic
Church. He possessed the affectionate regard of the
whole community, and naturally commanded a wide influence.
A Roman Catholic told me many years ago that,
upon one of the visits of the Archbishop to St. Peter's
church, he took the congregation to task for their exclusiveness,
exclaiming: "You lock up your pews and exclude
the marrow of the land."</p>

<p>I knew very well the Rev. Charles Constantine Pise,
the first native-born Catholic to officiate in St. Joseph's
church on Sixth Avenue. He was of Italian parentage
and was remarkable for his great physical attractiveness.
In addition to his fine appearance, he was exceedingly
social in his tastes and was consequently a highly agreeable
guest. He cultivated the muses to a modest degree,
and I have several of his poetical effusions, one of which
was addressed to me. In spite of the admiration he commanded
from both men and women, irrespective of creed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
life seemed to present to him but few allurements. Archbishop
Hughes sent him to a small Long Island parish
where, after laboring long and earnestly, he closed his
earthly career. An anecdote is related of this pious man
which I believe to be true. A young woman quite forgetful
of the proprieties and conventionalties of life, but
with decided matrimonial proclivities, made Father Pise
an offer of her fortune, heart and hand. In a dignified
manner he advised her to give her heart to God, her
money to the poor, and her hand to the man who asked
for it. Prior to his rectorship of St. Joseph's church in
New York, Father Pise, who was an intimate friend of
Henry Clay, served as Chaplain of the U.S. Senate during
a portion of the 22d Congress. At the National
Capital as well as in New York he was exceptionally
popular, making many converts, especially among young
women, and preaching to congregations in churches so
densely crowded that it was difficult to obtain even standing
room.</p>

<p>I cannot pass the Roman Catholic clergy without some
reference to the Rev. Felix Varela, a priest of Spanish descent
and, it is said, of noble birth, who was sent from
Cuba to Spain as one of the deputies to the Cortes from his
native island. His church was St. Peter's in Barclay Street.
It would be difficult for any words to do justice to his life
of self-abnegation or to his adherence to the precepts of
his Divine Master. It is with pleasure, therefore, that I
relate the following story, for the truth of which I can
vouch. A policeman found a handsome pair of silver
candlesticks in the custody of a poor unfortunate man,
and as they bore upon them a distinctive coat of arms he
arrested him. On his way to prison the suspected criminal
begged to see Father Varela for a moment, and as his
residence was <i>en route</i> to the station house the officer
granted his request. This good priest informed the policeman
with much reluctance that the candlesticks had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
formerly belonged to him, and that he had given them to
his prisoner to buy bread for his family. My father was
so deeply in sympathy with the life and character of this
priest that, although of a different faith, he seldom heard
his name mentioned without an expression of admiration
for his life and character.</p>

<p>There was a French Protestant church in Franklin
Street ministered to by the Rev. Dr. Antoine Verren,
whose wife was a daughter of Thomas Hammersley. I
also remember very well a Presbyterian church on Laight
Street, opposite St. John's Park, the rector of which was
the Rev. Dr. Samuel H. Cox, an uncle of the late Bishop
Arthur Cleveland Cox of the Episcopal Church. Dr. Cox
was a prominent abolitionist, and when we were living on
Hubert Street, just around the corner, this church was
stoned by a mob because the rector had expressed his anti-slavery
views too freely.</p>

<p>The mode of conducting funerals in former days in New
York differed very materially from the customs now in
vogue. While the coffins of the well-to-do were made entirely
of mahogany and without handles, I have always
understood that persons of the Hebrew faith buried their
dead in pine coffins, as they believed this wood to be more
durable. Pall-bearers wore white linen scarfs three yards
long with a rosette of the same material fastened on one
shoulder, which, together with a pair of black gloves, was
always presented by the family. It was originally the intention
that the linen scarf should be used after the funeral
for making a shirt. Funerals from churches were not as
customary as at the present time. If the body was to be
interred within the city limits every one attending the services,
including the family, walked to the cemetery. It was
unusual for a woman to be seen at a funeral.</p>

<p>But the whole social tone of New York society was more
<i>de rigueur</i> than now. Sometimes, for example, persons living
under a cloud of insufficient magnitude to place them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
behind prison bars, feeling their disgrace, took flight for
Texas. Instead of placing the conventional <i>P.P.C.</i> on
their cards the letters <i>G.T.T.</i> were used, meaning that the
self-expatriated ne'er-do-well had "gone to Texas." I
have always understood that in Great Britain the transgressor
sought the Continent, where he was often enabled
to pass into oblivion. In this manner both countries were
relieved of patriots who "left their country for their
country's good." As an example, I remember hearing
in my early life of an Englishman named de Roos, who
had the unfortunate habit of arranging cards to suit his
own fancy. When his <i>confr&egrave;res</i> finally caught him in
the act he left hurriedly for the Continent.</p>

<p>In 1842 the U.S. sloop of war <i>Somers</i> arrived in New
York, and the country was startled by the accounts of
what has since been known as the "Somers Mutiny." The
Captain of the ship was Commander Alexander Slidell
Mackenzie, whose original surname was Slidell. He was
a brother of the Hon. John Slidell, at one time U.S. Senator
from Louisiana, who, during the Civil War, while on
his passage to England on the <i>Trent</i> as a representative
of the Southern Confederacy in England, was captured
by Captain Charles Wilkes of the U.S. Navy. The result
of the alleged mutiny was the execution, by hanging
at the yard arm, of Philip Spencer, a son of the celebrated
New York lawyer, John C. Spencer, President Tyler's
Secretary of War, and of two sailors, Samuel Cromwell and
Elisha Small. It was charged that they had conspired to
capture the ship and set adrift or murder her officers.
Being far from any home port, and uncertain of the extent
to which the spirit of disaffection had permeated the crew,
Mackenzie consulted the officers of his ship as to the proper
course for him to pursue. In accordance with their advice,
and after only a preliminary examination of witnesses
and no formal trial with testimony for the defense, they
were, as just stated, summarily executed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>I speak from the point of view of the legal element of
New York, as my father's associates were nearly all professional
men. The world was aghast upon receiving the
news that three men had been hurled into eternity without
judge or jury. Spencer was a lad of less than nineteen
and a midshipman. Although Captain Mackenzie's action
was sustained by the court of inquiry, which was convened
in his case, as well as by the <i>esprit de corps</i> of the Navy,
public feeling ran so high that a court martial was ordered.
His trial of two months' duration took place at the
Brooklyn Navy Yard, and resulted in a verdict of "not
proven." The judge-advocate of the court was Mr. William
H. Norris of Baltimore, and Mackenzie was defended
by Mr. George Griffith and Mr. John Duer, the
latter of whom was the distinguished New York jurist
and the uncle of Captain Mackenzie's wife. At the request
of the Hon. John C. Spencer, Benjamin F. Butler
and Charles O'Conor, leaders of the New York bar, formally
applied for permission to ask questions approved
by the court and to offer testimony, but the request was
refused&mdash;"so that," as Thomas H. Benton expressed it,
"at the long <i>post mortem</i> trial which was given to the
boy after his death, the father was not allowed to ask one
question in favor of his son." After a lapse of sixty-nine
years, judging from Mackenzie's report to the
Navy Department, it almost seems as if he possessed a
touch of medi&aelig;val superstition. He speaks of Spencer
giving money and tobacco to the crew, of his being extremely
intimate with them, that he had a strange flashing
of the eye, and finally that he was in the habit of
amusing the sailors by making music with his jaws. Mackenzie
in his official report stated that this lad "had the
faculty of throwing his jaw out of joint and by contact
of the bones playing with accuracy and elegance a variety
of airs." James Fenimore Cooper stated it as his opinion,
"that such was the obliquity of intellect shown by Mac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>kenzie
in the whole affair, that no analysis of his motives
can be made on any consistent principle of human action;"
and the distinguished statesman, Thomas H.
Benton, whose critical and lengthy review of the whole
case would seem to carry conviction to unprejudiced
minds, declared that the three men "died innocent, as
history will tell and show."</p>

<p>The proceedings of the Mackenzie trial were eagerly
read by an interested public. As I remember the testimony
given regarding Spencer's last moments upon earth,
Mackenzie announced to the youthful culprit that he had
but ten minutes to live. He fell at once upon his knees
and exclaimed that he was not fit to die, and the Captain
replied that he was aware of the fact, but could not help
it. It is recorded that he read his Bible and Prayer-Book,
and that the Captain referred him to the "penitent thief;"
but when he pleaded that his fate would kill his mother
and injure his father, Mackenzie made the inconsiderate
reply that the best and only service he could render his
father was to die.</p>

<p>I recall a conversation bearing upon the <i>Somers</i> tragedy
which I overheard between my father and his early
friend, Thomas Morris, when their indignation was boundless.
The latter's son, Lieutenant Charles W. Morris,
U.S.N., had made several cruises with the alleged mutineer
Cromwell. Meeting Mackenzie he stated this fact,
saying at the same time that he found him a well-disposed
and capable seaman. Mackenzie quickly responded that
"he had a bad eye," and then Lieutenant Morris recalled
that the unfortunate man had a cast in one eye.</p>

<p>A few years after his court-martial Mackenzie fell dead
from his horse. One of the wardroom officers of the
<i>Somers</i> was Adrian D&eacute;slonde of Louisiana, whose sister
married the Hon. John Slidell, of whom I have already
spoken as Commander Mackenzie's brother.</p>

<p>I seldom hear the name of John Slidell without being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
reminded of a witticism which I heard from my mother's
lips, the author of which was Louisa Fairlie, a daughter
of Major James Fairlie, who, during the War of the Revolution,
served upon General Steuben's staff. She was, I
have understood, a great belle with a power of repartee
which bordered upon genius. During the youth of John
Slidell he attended a dinner at a prominent New York
residence and sat at the table next to Miss Fairlie. In
a tactless manner he made a pointedly unpleasant remark
bearing upon the marriage of her sister Mary to the distinguished
actor, Thomas Apthorpe Cooper, a subject upon
which the Fairlie family was somewhat sensitive. Miss
Fairlie regarded Mr. Slidell for only a moment, and then
retorted: "Sir, you have been <i>dipped</i> not <i>moulded</i> into
society"&mdash;an incident which, by the way, I heard repeated
many years later at a dinner in China. To appreciate
this witticism, one may refer to the New York directory
of 1789, which describes John Slidell, the father of the
Slidell of whom we are speaking, as "soap boiler and
chandler, 104 Broadway." Miss Fairlie's pun seems to
me to be quite equal to that of Rufus Choate, who, when a
certain Baptist minister described himself as "a candle of
the Lord," remarked, "Then you are a dipped, but I hope
not a wick-ed candle." It is said that upon another occasion,
after the return of Mr. Slidell from a foreign trip,
he was asked by Miss Fairlie whether he had been to
Greece. He replied in the negative and asked the reason
for her query. "Oh, nothing," she said, "only it would
have been very natural for you to visit Greece in order to
renew early associations!" Many years thereafter Priscilla
Cooper, the wife of Robert Tyler and the daughter-in-law
of President John Tyler, a daughter of Thomas
Apthorpe Cooper and his wife, Mary Fairlie, presided at
the White House during the widowhood of her distinguished
father-in-law.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, the father of the Hon. John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Slidell was a chandler, and he conducted his business with
such success that in time he became prominent in mercantile
and financial circles, and eventually was made president
of the Mechanics Bank and the Tradesmen's Insurance
Company. His son John, who at first engaged in
his father's soap and tallow business as an apprentice,
finally succeeded him, and the enterprise was continued
under the firm name of "John Slidell, Jr. and Company."
The house failed, however, and it is said that this fact,
together with the scandal attending his duel with Stephen
Price, manager of the Park Theater, in which the latter
was wounded, were the controlling factors that led the
future Hon. John Slidell to remove his residence to New
Orleans. In this place he became highly celebrated as a
lawyer, and his successful political career is well known.
He married Miss Marie Mathilde D&eacute;slonde, a member of
a well-known Creole family, and many persons still living
will recall her grace and <i>savoir faire</i> in Washington when
her husband represented Louisiana in the United States
Senate. Miss Jane Slidell, a sister of the Hon. John
Slidell, married Commodore Matthew C. Perry, U.S.N.,
who opened the doors of Japan to the trade of the world,
and whose daughter, Caroline Slidell Perry, became the
wife of the late August Belmont of New York, while Julia,
another of Mr. Slidell's sisters, married the late Rear
Admiral C. R. P. Rodgers, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>U.S.N.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>LONG BRANCH, NEWPORT AND ELSEWHERE</h3>


<p>When I was about ten years of age, accompanied
by my parents, I made a visit to Long Branch,
which was then one of the most fashionable summer
resorts for New Yorkers. As we made the journey
by steamboat and the water was rough we were the victims
of a violent attack of seasickness from which few of
the passengers escaped. Many Philadelphians also spent
their summers at this resort, and there was naturally a
fair sprinkling of people from other large cities. At that
time there were no hotels in the place, but there was
one commodious boarding house which accommodated
a large number of guests. It bore no name, but was designated
as "Mrs. Sairs'," from its proprietress. In this
establishment our whole family, by no means small, found
accommodations. I recall many pleasant acquaintances we
made while there, especially that of Miss Molly Hamilton
of Philadelphia. She was a vivacious old lady, and
was accompanied by her nephew, Hamilton Beckett, in
whom I found a congenial playmate. His name made a
strong impression upon my memory, as I was then reading
the history of Thomas &agrave; Becket, the murdered Archbishop
of Canterbury. I have heard that this friend of
my childhood went eventually to England to reside. The
Penningtons of Newark had a cottage near us. William
Pennington subsequently became Governor of New Jersey.
I also enjoyed the youthful companionship of his
daughter Mary, whom many years later I met in Washington.
In the interval she had become a pronounced
belle and the wife of Hugh A. Toler of Newark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The guests of the boarding house were inclined to complain
that the beach was too exclusively appropriated by
two acquaintances of ours who were living in the same
house with us, Mrs. G. W. Featherstonhaugh and Mrs.
Thomas M. Willing, and their train of admirers. They were
sprightly young women and daughters of Bernard Moore
Carter of Virginia. I remember it was the gossip of the
place that both of them could count their offers of marriage
by the score. Mrs. Willing was a skilled performer
upon the harp, an instrument then much in vogue, but
whose silvery tones are now, alas, only memory's echo.
Mr. Featherstonhaugh, who was by birth an Englishman,
after residing in the United States a few years, wrote in
1847 a book entitled "Excursion through the Slave States
from Washington on the Potomac to the Frontier of
Mexico." I recall that in this volume he spoke with enthusiasm
of the <i>agr&eacute;ments</i> of the palate which he enjoyed
during a few days' sojourn at Barnum's Hotel in Baltimore.
He dwelt particularly, with gastronomic ecstasy,
upon the canvas-back duck and soft-shell crab upon which
he feasted, and was inclined to draw an unfavorable comparison
between the former hotel and Gadsby's, the well-known
Washington hostelry. Upon his journey he visited
Monticello, the former home of Thomas Jefferson.
His encomium on this distinguished man appealed to me
as I am sure it does to others; he spoke of him as the
"Confucius of his country." Altogether, Mr. Featherstonhaugh's
experiences in America were as novel and entertaining
as a sojourn with Aborigines.</p>

<p>Just off the beach at Long Branch was a high bluff
which descended gradually to the sea, and at this point
were several primitive bath houses belonging to Mrs.
Sairs' establishment. Following the prevalent custom, we
wore no bathing shoes and stockings, but, accompanied
by a stalwart bathing master, we enjoyed many dips in
the briny deep, and were brought safely back by him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
our bath house. There was no immodest lingering on the
beach; this privilege was reserved for the advanced civilization
of a later day.</p>

<p>While I was still a young child, and some years after our
visit to Long Branch, my infant brother Malcolm became
seriously ill. Dr. John W. Francis, our family physician,
prescribed a change of air for him, and my parents
took him to Newport. We found pleasant accommodations
for our family in a fashionable boarding house on
Thames Street, the guests of which were composed almost
exclusively of Southern families. Newport was then in
an exceedingly primitive state and I have no recollection
of seeing either cottages or hotels, while modern improvements
were unknown. We led a simple outdoor life,
taking our breakfast at eight, dining at two and supping
at six. It was indeed "early to bed and early to rise."</p>

<p>As I recall these early days in Newport, two fascinating
old ladies, typical Southern gentlewomen, the Misses
Philippa and Hetty Minus of Savannah, present themselves
vividly to my memory. After we returned to our
New York home we had the pleasure of meeting them
again and entertaining them. Another charming guest
of our establishment was the wife of James L. Pettigru,
an eminent citizen of South Carolina. She was the first
woman of fashion presented to my girlish vision, and
her mode of life was a revelation. She kept very late
hours, often lingering in her room the next morning until
midday. As I was then familiar with Miss Edgeworth's
books for young people, which all judicious parents purchased
for their children, I immediately designated Mrs.
Pettigru as "Lady Delacour," whose habits and fashions
are so pleasingly described in that admirable novel, "Belinda."
Although born and bred in South Carolina, Mr.
Pettigru remained loyal to the Union, and after his death
his valuable library was purchased by Congress. The
members of another representative South Carolina family,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the Allstons, were also among our fellow boarders at Long
Branch. This name always brings to mind the pathetic
history of Theodosia Burr, Aaron Burr's only child, and
her sad death; while the name of Washington Allston, the
artist, is too well known to be dwelt upon.</p>

<p>After a month's pleasant sojourn in Newport my brother's
health had materially improved and we returned to
our New York home by the way of Boston, where we
were guests at the Tremont House. I blush to acknowledge
to the Bostonians who may peruse these pages that
my chief recollection of this visit is that I was standing
on the steps of the hotel, when I was accosted by a gentleman,
who exclaimed: "You are a Campbell, I'll bet ten
thousand dollars!" I apologize for writing such a personal
reminiscence of such an historic town, but such
are the freaks of memory. This was prior to the maturer
days of William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips and
Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>

<p>Before passing on to other subjects I must not omit
mentioning that at this period the currency used in the
New England States differed from that of New York.
This fact was brought vividly before me in Newport when
I made an outlay of a shilling at a candy store. In return
for my Mexican quarter of a dollar I was handed a
small amount of change. I left the shop fully convinced
that I was a victim of sharp practice, but learned later
that there was a slight difference between the shilling used
in New York and that used in New England.</p>

<p>Many years later I visited Boston again, this time as
the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Robert C. Winthrop at their
superb Brookline home; and, escorted by Mr. Winthrop
and Mr. and Mrs. Jabez L. M. Curry of Alabama, who
were also their house-guests, I visited all the points of
historical interest. Both Mr. Winthrop and Mr. Curry
were then trustees of the Peabody Fund. A few years
after we separated in Boston Mr. and Mrs. Curry went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to Spain to reside, where, as American Minister, he was
present at the birth of King Alfonso of Spain.</p>

<p>About fifteen years later I again visited Newport, but
this time I was a full-fledged young woman. During my
absence a large number of hotels and cottages had been
erected, many of which were occupied by Southern families
who still continued to regard this Rhode Island resort
as almost exclusively their own. I recall the names of
many of them, all of whom were conspicuous in social life
in the South. Among them were the Middletons, whose
ancestors were historically prominent; the Pinckneys, descended
from the illustrious Charles Cotesworth Pinckney,
who uttered the well-known maxim, "Millions for
defense but not one cent for tribute;" the Izards; the
Draytons, of South Carolina; and the Habershams of
Georgia. During this visit in Newport I was the guest,
at their summer cottage, of my life-long friends, the
Misses Mary and Margaret Gelston, daughters of Maltby
Gelston, former President of the Manhattan Bank of
New York. Not far from the Gelstons resided what Sam
Weller would call three "widder women." They were
sisters, the daughters of Ralph Izard of Dorchester, S.C.,
and bore distinguished South Carolina names; Mrs. Poinsett
who had been the wife of Joel Roberts Poinsett, the
well-known statesman and Secretary of War under Van
Buren, Mrs. Eustis, the widow of Gen. Abram Eustis,
U.S.A., who had served in the War of 1812, and Mrs.
Thomas Pinckney, whose husband, the nephew of General
Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, had been a wealthy rice
planter in South Carolina. The beautiful Christmas
flower, the poinsettia, was named in compliment to Mr.
Poinsett. These interesting women for many years were
in the habit of leaving what they called their "Carolina"
home for a summer sojourn at Newport, where their house
was one of the social centers of attraction. With their
graceful bearing, gentle voices and cordial manners they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
were characteristic types of the Southern <i>grandes dames</i>
now so seldom seen. A short distance from my hosts'
cottage lived the daughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton,
who was also the widow of Robert Goodloe Harper,
a prominent Federalist and a United States Senator during
the administrations of Madison and Monroe. Mrs.
Harper's sister married Richard Caton of Maryland,
whose daughters made such distinguished British matrimonial
alliances. Her daughter, Emily Harper, upon
whose personality I love to dwell, was from her earliest
childhood endowed with strong religious traits. Her
gentle Christian character exemplified charity to all who
were fortunate enough to come within the radius of her
influence. She was in every sense of the word a deeply
religious woman, and her influence upon those around her
was of the most elevating character.</p>

<p>I shall always remember with the keenest enjoyment
some of the pleasant teas at this hospitable home of the
Harpers in Newport. All sects were welcomed, Episcopalians,
Presbyterians, Hebrews, Unitarians, and I doubt
not that an equally cordial reception would have awaited
Mahommedans or Hindoos. I once heard Miss Harper
say that she shared with Chateaubriand the ennobling sentiment
that the salvation of one soul was of more value
than the conquest of a kingdom. Naturally the Harper
cottage was the rendezvous for Southerners and its hospitable
roof sheltered many prominent people, especially
guests from Maryland. Mr. Maltby Gelston told me at
the time of this visit that Mrs. Harper was the only child
of a Signer then living. It is probable that he spoke
from positive knowledge, as he was an authority upon the
subject, having married the granddaughter of Philip Livingston,
a New York Signer. A few years later, when I
was married in Washington, D.C., I was deeply gratified
when Miss Harper came from Baltimore to attend
my wedding. The marked attentions paid to her by Caleb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Cushing, then Attorney-General under President Pierce,
were the source of much gossip, but she seemed entirely
indifferent to his devotion. I once heard him express
great annoyance after a trip to Baltimore because he
failed to see her on account of a headache with which she
was said to be suffering, and he inquired of me in a petulant
manner whether headaches were an universal feminine
malady. Like her mother, she lived to a very advanced
age and when she departed this life the world lost
one of its saintliest characters.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive cottages in Newport at the
time of my second visit was occupied by Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Casimir de Rham of New York. It was densely
shaded by a number of graceful silver-maple trees. Mr.
de Rham was a prosperous merchant of Swiss extraction,
whose wife was Miss Maria Theresa Moore, a member of
one of New York's most prominent families and a niece
of Bishop Benjamin Moore of New York.</p>

<p>The social leaders of Newport at this period were Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Morgan Gibbes, whose winter home was in
New York. Mr. Gibbes, who, by the way, was a great-uncle
of William Waldorf Astor, was a South Carolinian by
birth and had married Miss Emily Oliver of Paterson, New
Jersey. They lived in a handsome house, gave sumptuous
entertainments, and had an interesting family of daughters,
several of whom I knew quite well. One well-remembered
evening I attended a party at their house which was regarded
as the social affair of the season. It made a lasting
impression upon my mind owing to a trivial circumstance
which seems hardly worth relating. It was the
first time I had ever seen mottoes used at entertainments,
and at this party they were exceptionally handsome. The
one which fell to my share, and which I treasured for
some time, bore upon it a large bunch of red currants.
These favors were always imported, and a few years later
became so fashionable that no dinner or supper table was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
regarded as quite the proper thing without them. I take
it for granted that this custom was the origin of the german
favors which in the course of time came into such
general use.</p>

<p>In 1853 I made a third visit to Newport as the guest
of Mrs. Winfield Scott. General Scott's headquarters
were then in Washington, but, as his military views were
widely divergent from those of Jefferson Davis, President
Pierce's Secretary of War, he was urging the President
to transfer him to New York. I have frequently heard
the General jocosely remark that he longed for a Secretary
of War who would not "make him cry." The
Scotts at this period were spending their winters in Washington
and their summers in Newport. Meanwhile his
numerous admirers, in recognition of his distinguished
services, presented him with a house on West Twelfth
Street which was occupied by him and his family after
his transfer to New York. The principal donor of this
residence was the Hon. Hamilton Fish.</p>

<p>After a charming sojourn of several weeks in Newport,
I was about returning to my home when I casually
invited General Scott's youngest daughter, Marcella
("Ella"), then only a schoolgirl, to accompany me to
Miss Harper's cottage, as I wished to say good-bye. Upon
entering the drawing-room a cousin and guest of Miss
Harper's, Charles Carroll McTavish of Howard County,
Maryland, appeared upon the threshold and was introduced
to us. He was then approaching middle life and I
learned later that he had served some years in the Russian
Army. Marcella Scott's appearance apparently fascinated
him from the moment they met, and from that day
he began to be devotedly attentive to her. Mrs. Scott,
however, entirely disapproved of Mr. McTavish's attentions
to her daughter on account of her extreme youth. A
few months later Marcella returned to Madame Chegaray's
school, where she became a boarding pupil and was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
allowed to see visitors. The following winter she was
taken ill with typhoid fever, and, when convalescent
enough to be moved, was brought to my home in Houston
Street, New York, to recuperate, as the Scotts were still
living in Washington and the journey was considered too
long and arduous to be taken by an invalid. Meanwhile,
Mr. McTavish renewed his attentions to Miss Scott and
the impression made was more than a passing fancy for
in the following June they were married in the Twelfth
Street house of which I have already spoken, General
Scott having in the interim succeeded in having his headquarters
removed to New York.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of being present at this wedding,
which, in spite of a warm day in June and the many
absentees from the city, was one of exceptional brilliancy.
The Army and Navy were well represented, the
officers of both branches of the service appearing in
full-dress uniform. The hour appointed for the ceremony
was high noon, but an amusing <i>contretemps</i> blocked
the way. An incorrigible mantua-maker, faithless to all
promises and regardless of every sense of propriety,
failed to send home the bridal dress at the appointed
time. This state of affairs proved decidedly embarrassing,
but the guests were informed of the cause of the delay
and patiently awaited developments. Behind the
scenes, however, quite a different spectacle was presented,
while amid much bustle and excitement a second wedding
gown was being hurriedly prepared. After an hour's
delay, however, the belated garment arrived, when the
bride-elect was quickly dressed and walked into the large
drawing-room in all of her bridal finery, leaning, as was
then the custom, upon the arm of the groom. Archbishop
Hughes conducted the wedding service, and seized upon
the auspicious occasion to make an address of some length.
Previous to the ceremony, my intimate friend, the young
bride's older sister, Cornelia Scott, who a few years pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>vious
had become while in Rome a convert to Catholicism,
asked me with much earnestness of manner to do my best
to entertain the Archbishop, as she thought, in her kind
way, that he might be somewhat out of his element when
surrounded by such a large and fashionable assemblage.
This was, indeed, a pleasing task, as it enabled me to renew
my earlier acquaintance with this gifted prelate.
The only member of the groom's family present at this
ceremony was his handsome brother, Alexander S. McTavish,
who came from Baltimore for the occasion. Strange
to say, in view of the many presents usually displayed
upon such occasions nowadays, I do not remember, although
I was a family guest, seeing or hearing of a single
bridal gift, but some of the wedding guests I recall very
distinctly. Among them were Mr. and Mrs. Charles
King, the former of whom was President of Columbia
College and an intimate friend of General Scott's; Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Ray, whose daughter Cornelia married
Major Schuyler Hamilton, aide-de-camp to General Scott
during the Mexican war; Prof. Clement C. Moore and his
daughter Theresa; Mr. and Mrs. Edward Mayo of Elizabeth,
N.J., the former of whom was Mrs. Scott's brother;
Mrs. Robert Henry Cabell, a sister of Mrs. Scott's from
Richmond; Major Thomas Williams, an aide to General
Scott, who was killed during the Civil War; and Major
Henry L. Scott, aide and son-in-law of General Scott.</p>

<p>The same evening, after the wedding guests had departed
and quiet again reigned supreme in the household,
I went to Mrs. Scott's room to sit with her, as
she seemed sad and lonely, and at the same time to
talk over with her, womanlike, the events of the day.
In our quiet conversation I remember referring to Archbishop
Hughes's address to the groom, and asked her if
she had observed that he had dwelt upon the bride "being
taken from an affectionate father," while the remaining
members of the family were entirely ignored. Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Scott immediately bristled up and with much warmth of
feeling said that she had noticed the omission and believed
that the action of the Archbishop was premeditated.
Just here was an undercurrent which as an intimate
friend of the family I fully understood. After Virginia
Scott's death at the Georgetown Convent Mrs. Scott was
most outspoken in her denunciation of the Roman Catholic
Church, which she felt had robbed her of her daughter.</p>

<p>Some years after his marriage Charles Carroll McTavish
applied to the Legislature of Maryland for permission to
drop his surname and to assume that of his great-grandfather,
Charles Carroll. As this request was strenuously
opposed by other descendants of the Signer, who regarded
it as inexpedient to increase the number of Charles Carrolls,
the petition of Mr. McTavish was not granted.
Mary Wellesley McTavish, his sister, I remember as a
sprightly young woman of fine appearance. She made
her <i>d&eacute;but</i> in London society as the guest of her aunt,
Mary McTavish, wife of the Marquis of Wellesley. After
a brief courtship she married Henry George Howard,
a son of the Earl of Carlisle, and accompanied him to the
Netherlands, where he was the accredited British Minister.
Mrs. George Bancroft, wife of the historian, who accompanied
her husband when he was our Minister to England,
gave me an interesting sketch of Mrs. Howard's varied
life. Death finally claimed her in Paris and her body
was brought back to this country and buried in Maryland,
the home of her youth. Her mother, who brought the remains
across the ocean, soon after her bereavement, established
"The House of the Good Shepherd" in Baltimore.</p>

<p>Three daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Carroll McTavish
grew into womanhood. The elder sisters, Mary
and Emily, both of whom were well known for their
beauty and vivacity, entered upon cloistered lives. Just
as the two sisters were about taking this step, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
made a request, which caused much comment, to the effect
that they should be assigned to different convents. I
understand that Mrs. McTavish, their mother, is still living
in Rome with the unmarried daughter. During Mrs.
Scott's residence in Paris she was invited to witness the
ceremony of "taking the veil" at a prominent convent,
and writing to her family at home she remarked: "How
strange that human beings, knowing the fickleness of their
natures, should bind themselves for life to one limited
space and unvarying mode of existence."</p>

<p>Hoboken, or, as it was sometimes called, Paulus Hook,
was a great resort in my earlier life for residents of the
great metropolis. We children, accompanied by my
father or some other grown person, delighted to roam in
that locality over what was most appropriately termed
the "Elysian Fields." Professional landscape-gardening
had not then been thought of, but nature's achievements
often surpass the embellishments of man. Our cup
of happiness was full to the brim when we were taken to
this entrancing spot overlooking the Hudson River, with
its innumerable sloops, steamboats and tugs adding so
much to the picturesqueness of the scene. As we strolled
along, we regaled ourselves every now and then with a refreshing
glass of mead, a concoction of honey and cold
water, purchased from a passing vender; and when cakes
or candy were added to the refreshing drink life seemed
very <i>couleur de rose</i> to our childish dreams. Then again
we made occasional trips up the river, but the steamboats
and other excursion craft of that day were of course mere
pigmies compared with those of the present time. The
cabin always had a large dining table, on either side of
which was a line of berths. Guests were called to dinner
at one o'clock by the vigorous ringing of a large bell
in the hands of a colored waiter dressed in a white
apron and jacket. I have often thought how surprised
and pleased this old-time servant, universally seen in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
every well-to-do household in those days, would be if he
could return to earth and hear himself addressed as
"butler."</p>

<p>It was upon one of these trips up the Hudson that the
widow of General Alexander Hamilton and her daughter,
Mrs. Hamilton Holly, were taking their mid-day repast,
at one end of the long table, when they were informed
that Aaron Burr was partaking of the same meal not far
from them. Their indignation was boundless, and immediately
there were two vacant chairs. Mrs. Holly was
a woman of strong intellect, and a friendship which I
formed with her is one of the most cherished memories
of my life. She devoted her widowhood to the care of her
aged mother. We often engaged in confidential conversations,
when she would discuss the tragedies which so
clouded her life. I especially remember her dwelling
upon the sad history of her sister, Angelica Hamilton,
who, she told me, was in the bloom of health and surrounded
by everything that goes towards making life
happy when her eldest brother, Philip Hamilton, was
killed in a duel. He had but recently been graduated from
Columbia College and lost his life in 1801 on the same
spot where, about three years later, his father was killed
by Aaron Burr. This dreadful event affected her so
deeply that her mind became unbalanced, and she was
finally placed in an asylum, where she died at a very advanced
age. Mrs. Hamilton lived in Washington, D.C.,
in one of the De Menou buildings on H Street, between
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets, and Mrs. Holly resided
in the same city until her death.</p>

<p>Tragedy seemed to pursue the Hamilton family with
unrelenting perseverance until the third generation. In
1858 the legislature of Virginia, desiring that every native
President should repose upon Virginia soil, made an
appropriation for removing the remains of James Monroe
from New York to Richmond. He died on the 4th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of July, 1831, while temporarily residing in New York
with his daughter, Mrs. Samuel L. Gouverneur, and his
body was placed in the Gouverneur vault in the Marble
Cemetery on Second Street, east of Second Avenue, where
it remained for nearly thirty years. The disinterment
of the remains of this distinguished statesman was conducted
with much pomp and ceremony and the body
placed on board of the steamer <i>Jamestown</i> and conveyed
to Richmond, accompanied all the way by the 7th Regiment
of New York which acted as a guard of honor. The
orator of the occasion was John Cochrane, a distinguished
member of the New York bar; while Henry A. Wise, then
Governor of Virginia, delivered an appropriate address
at the grave in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. My
husband, Samuel L. Gouverneur, junior, Monroe's grandson,
accompanied the remains as the representative of the
family. After the ceremonies in Richmond were completed,
but before the 7th Regiment had embarked upon
its homeward voyage, one of its members, Laurens Hamilton,
a grandson of Alexander Hamilton and a son of John
C. Hamilton, was drowned near Richmond. All the proceedings
connected with the removal of Mr. Monroe's remains,
both in New York and in Richmond, were published
some years later by Udolpho Wolfe, a neighbor and
admirer of the late President. A copy of the book was
presented to each member of the 7th Regiment and one
of them was also given by the compiler to my husband.
A few years later this same New York regiment invaded
Virginia, but under greatly different circumstances. A
terrible civil war was raging, and the Old Dominion for
a time was its principal battle ground.</p>

<p>I recall an amusing anecdote which Mr. Gouverneur
told me upon his return from this visit to Richmond.
While the great concourse of people was still assembled
at Monroe's grave in Hollywood Cemetery, Governor
Henry A. Wise, always proud of his State, remarked:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
"Now we must have all the native Presidents of Virginia
buried within this inclosure." Immediately a vigorous
hand was placed on his shoulder by a New York alderman
who had accompanied the funeral <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>, who exclaimed
in characteristic Bowery vernacular: "Go ahead,
Governor, you'll fotch 'em."</p>

<p>The only mode of travel on the Hudson River in my
early days was by boat. One of my recollections is seeing
Captain Vanderbilt in command of a steamboat.
I have heard older members of my family say that
he designated himself "Captain Wanderbilt," and that
his faithful wife's endearing mode of accosting him
was "Corneil." At any rate, it is well-known that
he began life by operating a rowboat ferry between
Staten Island and New York. In later years a sailboat
was substituted over this same route. The Hudson River
Railroad was originally built under the direction of a
number of prominent men in the State who were anything
but skilled in such enterprises. In the beginning of its
career, while high officials bestowed fat offices upon friends
and relatives, its finances were in a chaotic condition. It
was during this state of affairs that Commodore Vanderbilt,
with a master mind, grasped the situation and reorganized
the whole system, thereby greatly increasing his
own fortune, and placing the railroad upon a sound
financial basis. After such a remarkable career "blindness
to the future" seems unkindly given, as doubtless it
would have been a source of great satisfaction to this
Vanderbilt progenitor could he have known before passing
onward that his hard-earned wealth would eventually
enrich his descendants, even the representatives of nobility.</p>

<p>I have before me an invitation to a New York Assembly,
dated the 29th of January, 1841, addressed to my father
and mother, which has followed my wanderings through
seventy years. All of the managers, a list of whom I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
give, were representative citizens as well as prominent
society men of the day:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Society Men">
<tr><td align='left'>Abm. Schermerhorn,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>J. Swift Livingston,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Edmd. Pendleton,</td><td align='left'>Jacob R. LeRoy,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>James W. Otis,</td><td align='left'>Thos. W. Ludlow,</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>Henry Delafield,</td><td align='left'>William S. Miller,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Henry W. Hicks,</td><td align='left'>Charles C. King.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Abraham Schermerhorn belonged to a wealthy New
York family, and Edmund Pendleton was a Virginian
by birth who resided in New York where he became
socially prominent. James W. Otis was of the Harrison
Gray Otis family of Boston and, as I have already stated,
I was at school with his daughter, Sally. William Douglas
was a bachelor living in an attractive residence on
Park Place, where he occasionally entertained his friends.
He belonged to a thrifty family of Scotch descent and had
two sisters, Mrs. Douglas Cruger and Mrs. James Monroe,
whose husband was a namesake and nephew of the ex-President.
Early in the last century their mother, Mrs.
George Douglas, gave a ball, and I insert some doggerel
with reference to it written by Miss Anne Macmaster,
who later became Mrs. Charles Russell Codman of Boston.
These verses are interesting from the fact that they
give the names of many of the <i>belles</i> and <i>beaux</i> of that
time:</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the old pamphlet from which I have already quoted,
edited in 1845 by Moses Y. Beach and compiled for the
purpose of furnishing information concerning the status
of New York citizens to banks, merchants and others, I
find the following amusing description of George Douglas:
"George Douglas was a Scotch merchant who
hoarded closely. His wine cellar was more extensive than
his library. When George used to see people speculating
and idle it distressed him. He would say: 'People get
too many <i>idees</i> in their head. Why don't they work?'
What a blessing he is not alive in this moonshine age of
dreamy schemings." Mr. Beach apparently was not capable
of appreciating a thrifty Scotchman.</p>

<p>This same pamphlet gives an account of a picturesque
character whom I distinctly remember as a highly prominent
citizen of New York. His parentage was involved
in mystery, and has remained so until this day. I refer
to Mr. Preserved Fish, the senior member of the firm of
Fish, Grinnell &amp; Co., which subsequently became the
prominent business house of Grinnell, Minturn &amp; Co.
Sustained by the apparel peculiar to infants, he was found
floating in the water by some New Bedford fishermen
who, unable to discover his identity, bestowed upon him
the uncouth name which, willingly or unwillingly, he bore
until the day of his death. He and the other members
of his firm were originally from New Bedford, one of the
chief centers of the whale fisheries of New England, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
came to New York to attend to the oil and candle industries
of certain merchants of the former city. Few business
men in New York in my day were more highly respected
for indomitable energy and personal integrity
than Mr. Fish. He became President of the Tradesmen's
Bank, and held other positions of responsibility and trust.
He represented an ideal type of the self-made man, and
in spite of an unknown origin and a ridiculous name battled
successfully with life without a helping hand.</p>

<p>In connection with the Douglas family, I recall a beautiful
wedding reception which, as well as I can remember,
took place in the autumn of 1850, at Fanwood, Fort
Washington, then a suburb of New York. The bride was
Fanny Monroe, a daughter of Colonel James Monroe,
U.S.A., and granddaughter of Mrs. Douglas of whose
ball I have just spoken. The groom was Douglas Robinson,
a native of Scotland. It was a gorgeous autumn day
when the votaries of pleasure and fashion in New York
drove out to Fanwood, where groomsmen of social prominence
stood upon the wide portico to greet the guests and
conduct them to the side of the newly married pair. Mrs.
Winfield Scott was our guest in Houston Street at the
time, but did not accompany us to the wedding as no invitation
had reached her. My presence reminded Mrs.
Monroe that Mrs. Scott was in New York, and she immediately
inquired why I had not brought her with me. As
I gave the reason both Colonel and Mrs. Monroe seemed
exceedingly annoyed. It seems that her invitation had
been sent to Washington but had not been forwarded to
her in New York. In those days Mrs. Scott's distinguished
presence and sparkling repartee, together with
the fact that her husband was Commander-in-Chief of
the Army, added luster to every assemblage. The Army
was well represented at this reception and it was truly
"the feast of reason and the flow of soul." Colonel
"Jimmy" Monroe was a great favorite with his former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
brother-in-arms as he was a genial, whole-souled and hospitable
gentleman. My sister Margaret and I were accompanied
to Fanwood by an army officer, Colonel Donald
Fraser, a bachelor whom I had met some years before
at West Point. The paths of the bride and myself diverged,
and it was a very long time before we met again.
It was only a few years ago, while she was residing temporarily
in Washington. She was then, however, a widow
and was living in great retirement. She is now deceased.</p>

<p>When we alighted from our carriage the day of the
Monroe-Robinson wedding at Fanwood a young man
whom I subsequently learned was Mr. Samuel L. Gouverneur,
junior, a cousin of the bride, walked over to me,
asked my name and in his capacity of groomsman inquired
whether I would allow him to present me to the
bride. I was particularly impressed by his appearance,
as it was unusually attractive. He had raven-black hair,
large bluish-gray eyes and regular features; but what
added to his charm in my youthful fancy was the fact
that he had only recently returned from the Mexican War,
in which, as I learned later, he had served with great gallantry
in the 4th Artillery. I had never seen him before,
although in thinking the matter over a few days later I
remembered that I had met his mother and sister in society
in New York. I did not see him again until five
years later, when our paths crossed in Washington, and
in due time I became his bride.</p>

<p>To return to the New York Assembly in 1841. Henry
Delafield, whose name appears on the card of invitation,
belonged to a well-known family. His father, an Englishman
by birth, settled in New York in 1783 and is described
in an early city directory as "John Delafield, Insurance
Broker, 29 Water Street." The Delafields were
a large family of brothers and were highly prosperous.
I remember once hearing Dr. John W. Francis say: "Put
a Delafield on a desert island in the middle of the ocean,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and he will thrive and prosper." Henry Delafield and
his brother William were almost inseparable. They were
twins and strikingly alike in appearance. General Richard
Delafield, U.S.A., for many years Superintendent
of the Military Academy at West Point, was another
brother, as was also Dr. Edward Delafield, a physician
of note, who lived in Bleecker Street and in 1839 married
Miss Julia Floyd of Long Island, a granddaughter of
William Floyd, one of the New York Signers. About
thirty-five years ago three of the Delafield brothers,
Joseph, Henry and Edward, all advanced in life, died
within a few days of each other and were buried in Greenwood
Cemetery at the same time, the funeral taking place
from old Trinity Church. On this occasion all the old
customs were observed, and the coffins were made of solid
mahogany.</p>

<p>John Swift Livingston lived in Leonard Street, and I
recall very pleasantly a party which I attended at his
house before the marriage of his daughter Estelle to General
John Watts de Peyster. The latter, together with
his first cousins, General "Phil" Kearny and Mrs. Alexander
Macomb, inherited an enormous fortune from his
grandfather John Watts, who was one of the most prominent
men of his day and the founder of the Leake and
Watts Orphan House, which is still in existence. John G.
Leake was an Englishman who came to New York to live
and, dying without heirs, left his fortune to Robert Watts,
a minor son of John Watts. Robert Watts, however, did
not long survive his benefactor. Upon his death the
Leake will was contested by his relatives, but a decision
was rendered in favor of the nearest kin of the boy, who
was his father. After gaining his victory John Watts
established this Orphan House and with true magnanimity
placed Leake's name before his own. Jacob R. LeRoy
lived in Greenwich Street near the Battery, which
at this time was a fashionable section of the city. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
sister Caroline, whom I knew, became the second wife of
Daniel Webster. Mr. LeRoy's daughter Charlotte married
Rev. Henry de Koven, whose son is the musical genius,
Reginald de Koven. Henry W. Hicks was the son of a
prominent Quaker merchant and a member of the firm of
Hicks &amp; Co., which did an enormous shipping business
until its suspension, about 1847, owing to foreign business
embarrassments. Thomas W. Ludlow was a wealthy citizen,
genial and most hospitably inclined. He owned a
handsome country-seat near Tarrytown, and every now
and then it was his pleasure to charter a steamboat to
convey his guests thither; and I recall several pleasant
days I spent in this manner. When we reached the Tarrytown
home a fine collation always awaited us and in its
wake came music and dancing. Charles McEvers, junior,
belonged to an old New York family and was one of the
executors of the Vanden Heuvel estate. His niece, Mary
McEvers, married Sir Edward Cunard, who was knighted
by Queen Victoria. William Starr Miller married a niece
of Philip Schuyler, who was a woman possessing many
excellent traits of character. As far as I can remember,
she was the only divorced person of those days who was
well received in society, for people with "past histories"
were then regarded with marked disfavor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>SOME DISTINGUISHED ACQUAINTANCES</h3>


<p>In close proximity to St. John's Park, during my early
life on Hubert Street, there resided a Frenchman
named Laurent Salles, and I have a vivid recollection
of a notable marriage which was solemnized in his mansion.
The groom, Lispenard Stewart, married his daughter,
Miss Louise Stephanie Salles, but the young and pretty
bride survived her marriage for only a few years. She
left two children, one of whom is Mrs. Frederick Graham
Lee, whom I occasionally see in Washington, where with
her husband she spends her winters.</p>

<p>When playing in St. John's Park in this same neighborhood,
I made the acquaintance of Margaret Tillotson Kemble,
one of the young daughters of William Kemble already
mentioned as living on Beach Street, opposite that Park.
Mr. Kemble was the son of Peter Kemble, member of the
prominent firm of "Gouverneur and Kemble," shipping
merchants of New York, which traded with China and
other foreign countries. This firm, the senior members of
which were the brothers Nicholas and Isaac Gouverneur,
was bound together by a close family tie, as Mrs. Peter
Kemble was Gertrude Gouverneur, a sister of the two
Gouverneur brothers. My intimacy with Margaret Tillotson
Kemble, formed almost from the cradle, lasted without
a break throughout life. She was a second cousin of my
husband and married Charles J. Nourse, a member of the
old Georgetown, D.C., family. The last years of her life
were entirely devoted to good works. Her sister, Mary,
married Dr. Frederick D. Lente, at one time physician to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the West Point foundry, at Cold Spring, N.Y., and subsequently
a distinguished general practitioner in New
York and Saratoga Springs. Ellen Kemble, the other sister,
of whom I have already spoken, never married. She
was eminent for her piety, and her whole life was largely
devoted to works of charity.</p>

<p>The Kemble house on Beach Street was always a social
center and I think I can truthfully say it was more than
a second home to me. Mrs. William Kemble, who was
Miss Margaret Chatham Seth of Maryland, was a woman
of decided social tastes and a most efficient assistant to
her husband in dispensing hospitality. Gathered around
her hearthstone was a large family of girls and boys who
naturally added much brightness to the household. Mr.
Kemble was a well-known patron of art and his house became
the rendezvous for persons of artistic tastes. It was
in his drawing-room that I met William Cullen Bryant;
Charles B. King of Washington, whose portraits are so
well known; John Gadsby Chapman, who painted the "Baptism
of Pocahontas," now in the rotunda of the Capitol at
Washington; Asher B. Durand, the celebrated artist; and
Mr. Kemble's brother-in-law, James K. Paulding, who at
the time was Secretary of the Navy under President Martin
Van Buren. Mr. Kemble was one of the founders of
the Century Club of New York, a life member of the
Academy of Design, and in 1817, at the age of twenty-one,
in conjunction with his older brother, Gouverneur Kemble,
established the West Point foundry, which for a long
period received heavy ordnance contracts from the United
States government. The famous Parrott guns were manufactured
there. Captain Robert P. Parrott, their inventor
and an army officer, married Mary Kemble, a sister of
Gouverneur and William Kemble, who in early life was
regarded as a beauty. Mr. William Kemble, apart from
his artistic tastes, owned a number of fine pictures, among
which was a Sappho by a Spanish master. It was given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to Mrs. Kemble by the grandfather of the late Rear
Admiral Richard W. Meade, U.S.N. When the Kemble
family left Beach Street and moved to West Twenty-fifth
Street this picture was sold to Gouverneur Kemble
for $5,000, and placed in his extensive picture gallery at
Cold Spring.</p>

<p>Mrs. William Kemble was a woman of marked ability
and an able <i>raconteurse</i>. Early in life she had been left
an orphan and was brought up by her maternal uncle, Dr.
Thomas Tillotson of the Eastern shore of Maryland, whose
wife was Margaret Livingston, a daughter of Judge Robert
R. Livingston and a sister of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston.
Another sister of Mrs. Tillotson was the widow
of General Richard Montgomery, of the Revolutionary
War, who fell at the battle of Quebec. The Tillotsons,
Livingstons and Montgomerys all owned fine residences
near Hyde Park on the Hudson; and a close intimacy
existed between the Tillotsons and the Kembles owing to the
fact that Mr. Kemble's first cousin, Emily Gouverneur,
married Mrs. Kemble's first cousin, Robert Livingston
Tillotson. William Kemble's younger brother, Richard
Frederick, married Miss Charlotte Morris, daughter of
James Morris of Morrisania, N.Y.</p>

<p>The summer home of William Kemble was in a large
grove of trees at Cold Spring and life under its roof
was indeed an ideal existence. I was their constant guest
and although it was a simple life it teemed with beauty
and interest. Our days were spent principally out of
doors and the sources of amusement were always near at
hand. As all of the Kembles were experts with the oar,
we frequently spent many hours on the Hudson. Another
unfailing source of pleasure was a frequent visit to West
Point to witness the evening parade. As we knew many
of the cadets they frequently crossed the river to take an
informal meal or enjoy an hour's talk on the attractive
lawn. Lieutenant Colonel (subsequently General) William<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
J. Hardee, who for a long time was Commandant of
Cadets at West Point, I knew quite well. Later in his
career he was ordered to Washington, where as a widower
he became a social lion, devoting himself chiefly to Isabella
Cass, a daughter of General Lewis Cass. His career in
the Confederate Army is too well known for me to relate.
After the Civil War I never saw him again, as he lived in
the South. During one of my visits at the Kembles General
Robert E. Lee was the Superintendent of the West
Point Military Academy, but of him I shall speak hereafter.</p>

<p>Among the cadets whom I recall are Henry Heth of
Virginia, an officer who was subsequently highly esteemed
in the Army, and who, at the breaking out of the Civil
War, followed the fortunes of his native state and became
a Major General in the Confederate Army; Innis N.
Palmer, whom I met many years later in Washington
when he had attained the rank of General; and Cadet
Daniel M. Beltzhoover of Pennsylvania, a musical genius,
who was a source of great pleasure to us but whose career
I have not followed.</p>

<p>At this period in the history of West Point Cozzen's
Hotel was the only hostelry within the military enclosure.
A man named Benny Havens kept a store in close proximity
to the Military Academy, but as it was not upon government
territory no cadet was allowed to enter the premises.
Although liquor was his principal stock in trade he
kept other articles of merchandise, but only as a cover for
his unlawful traffic. The cadets had their weaknesses then
as now, and as this shop was "forbidden fruit" many of
them visited his resort under the cover of darkness. If
caught there "after taps," the punishment was dismissal.
The following selections from a dozen verses written by
Lieutenant Lucius O'Brien, U.S.A., and others, which I
remember hearing the cadets frequently sing, were set to
the tune of "Wearing of the Green":<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, fill your glasses, fellows, and stand up in a row,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To singing sentimentally, we're going for to go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the army there's sobriety, promotion's very slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we'll sing our reminiscences of Benny Havens, oh!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Oh, Benny Havens, oh!&mdash;oh! Benny Havens oh!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So we'll sing our reminiscences of Benny Havens, oh!<br /></span>
</div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, fill up to our Generals, God bless the brave heroes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They're an honor to their country and a terror to her foes;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But live to see a thousand years at Benny Havens, oh!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here's a health to General Taylor, whose "rough and ready" blow<br /></span>

<span class="i0">May his country ne'er forget his deeds, and ne'er forget to show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She holds him worthy of a place at Benny Havens, oh!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Fill up the goblet to the brim, let no one shrinking go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May life's cares on his honored head fall light as flakes of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his fair fame be ever great at Benny Havens, oh!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lieutenant O'Brien died in the winter of 1841 and the
following verse to his memory was fittingly added to his
song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the courts of death and danger from Tampa's deadly shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There comes a wail of manly grief, "O'Brien is no more,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the land of sun and flowers his head lies pillowed low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more he'll sing "Petite Coquette" or Benny Havens, oh!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Since then numerous other verses have been added,
from time to time, and, for aught I know to the contrary,
the composition is still growing. After the death of General
Scott in 1866 the following verse was added:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Another star has faded, we miss its brilliant glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the veteran Scott has ceased to be a soldier here below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the country which he honored now feels a heart-felt woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we toast his name in reverence at Benny Havens, oh!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></div></div>

<p>I wish that I could recall more of these lines as some
of the prominent men of the Army were introduced in
the most suggestive fashion. Benny Havens doubtless has
been sleeping his last sleep for these many years, but I
am sure that some of these verses are still remembered by
many of the surviving graduates of West Point.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of William Kemble's cottage at Cold
Spring was the permanent home of his older brother, Gouverneur
Kemble. For a few years during his earlier life
he served as U.S. Consul at Cadiz, under the administration
of President Monroe. His Cold Spring home was of
historic interest and for many years was the scene of lavish
hospitality. General Scott once remarked that he was "the
most perfect gentleman in the United States." The most
distinguished men of the day gathered around his table,
and every Saturday night through the entire year a special
dinner was served at five o'clock&mdash;Mr. Kemble despised
the habitual three o'clock dinners of his neighbors&mdash;which
in time became historic entertainments. This meal
was always served in the picture gallery, an octagonal
room filled with valuable paintings, while breakfast and
luncheon were served in an adjoining room. All of the
professors and many of the officers at West Point, whom
Mr. Kemble facetiously termed "the boys," had a standing
invitation to these Saturday evening dinners. There
was an agreement, however, among the younger officers
that too many of them should not partake of his hospitality
at the same time, as his dining table would not accommodate
more than thirty guests. How well I remember
these older men, all of whom were officers in the Regular
Army: Professors William H. C. Bartlett, Dennis H. Mahan,
the father of Captain Alfred T. Mahan, U.S.N.,
Albert E. Church, and Robert W. Weir. If by any
chance Mr. Kemble, or "Uncle Gouv," as he was generally
known to the family connection, was obliged to be
absent from home, these entertainments took place just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the same, presided over by his sister, Mrs. Robert P. Parrott.
Indeed, I recall that during a tour of Europe
Mr. Kemble made with ex-President Van Buren these
Saturday dinner parties were continued for at least a
year.</p>

<p>Carving was considered a fine art in those days, an accomplishment
which has largely gone out of style since
the introduction of dinner <i>&agrave; la Russe</i>. A law existed in
Putnam County, in which Cold Spring is situated, which
forbade the killing of game during certain months in the
year. When a transgressor of this law succeeded in "laying
low" a pair of pheasants, they were nicknamed
"owls"; and I have seen two "owls" which, under these
circumstances, were almost unobtainable, carved in such a
proficient manner by "Uncle Gouv" that, although we
numbered over a score, each person received a "satisfying"
piece. His guests were most appreciative of his hospitality,
and I once heard General Scott say that he would
be willing to walk at least ten miles to be present at a
dinner at Gouverneur Kemble's. His wines were always
well selected as well as abundant. I have often known
him to have a house party of many guests who had the
privilege of remaining indefinitely if they so desired.
The actress Fanny Kemble and her father, though not related
to the New York family, were guests in his home
during one of their visits to America. She was a great
pedestrian, and I recall having a small stream of water in
the vicinity of Cold Spring called to my notice where,
during her rambles, she was known to stop and bathe her
feet.</p>

<p>Long before the War of the Revolution, Mr. Kemble's
aunt, Margaret Kemble, married General Thomas Gage,
Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in that conflict,
and resided with him in England. While I was living in
Frederick, Maryland, I sent "Uncle Gouv"&mdash;he was then
an old man and very appreciative of any attention&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
photograph of Whittier's heroine, Barbara Frietchie. He
in turn sent it to Viscount Henry Gage, a relative
of the British General. The English nobleman who was
familiar with the Quaker poet seemed highly pleased to
own the picture and commented favorably upon the firm
expression of the mouth and chin of this celebrated
woman.</p>

<p>Army officers were frequently stationed at Cold Spring
to inspect the guns cast at the Kemble foundry. Among
these I recall with much pleasure Major Alfred Mordecai
of the Ordnance Corps. He was a highly efficient officer
and previous to the Civil War rendered conspicuous
service to his country. He was a Southerner and at the
beginning of the war is said to have requested the War
Department to order him to some duty which did not involve
the killing of his kinsmen. His request was denied
and his resignation followed.</p>

<p>In the midst of the Civil War, after a protracted absence
from the country in China, I arrived in New York,
and one of the first items of news that was told me was
that the West Point foundry was casting guns for the
Confederacy. I speedily learned that this rumor was altogether
unfounded. It seems that some time before the
beginning of hostilities the State of Georgia ordered some
small rifled cannon from the West Point foundry with
the knowledge and consent of the Chief of the Ordnance
Department, General Alexander B. Dyer. Colonel William
J. Hardee, then Commandant-of-Cadets, was selected
to inspect these guns before delivery; but when they were
finished the war-cloud had grown to such proportions that
Robert P. Parrott, the head of the foundry at the time,
Gouverneur Kemble having retired from active business
eight or ten years previously, refused to forward them.
They lay at the foundry for some time, and were afterwards
bought by private parties from New York City and
presented to the government, thereby doing active service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
against the Confederacy. In his interesting book recently
published entitled "Retrospections of an Active Life,"
Mr. John Bigelow refers to this unfortunate rumor. He
says: "On the 21st of January, 1861, I met the venerable
Professor Weir, of the West Point Military Academy,
in the cars on our way to New York, when he told me
that Colonel Hardee, then the Commandant-of-Cadets at the
Academy, was buying arms for his native state of Georgia,
and that the Kembles, whose iron works were across the
river from West Point at Cold Spring, were filling a
large order for him." I knew Professor Weir very well,
and Mr. Bigelow's statement, I think, is a mistake, as all
of the professors at West Point were too loyal to Mr.
Gouverneur Kemble to allow wild rumors engendered by
war to remain uncontradicted.</p>

<p>This seems a fitting place to recall the pleasant friendship
I made with General Robert E. Lee long before he
became the Southern chieftain. I have already stated
that when I visited Cold Spring in other days he was
Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy. He was
a constant visitor at the Kembles, and his imposing presence
and genial manner are so well known as to render
a description of them altogether superfluous. Some years
later when I was visiting at the home of General Winfield
Scott in Washington I renewed my pleasing friendship
with him. There existed between these two eminent
soldiers a life-long attachment, and when the Civil War
was raging it seemed almost impossible to realize that
Scott and Lee represented opposite political views, as
hitherto they had always seemed to be so completely in
accord.</p>

<p>The Cold Spring colony was decidedly sociable, and a
dinner party at one of the many cottages was almost a
daily occurrence. Captain and Mrs. Robert P. Parrott
entertained most gracefully, and their residence was one
of the show-places of that locality. I have heard Cap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>tain
Parrott facetiously remark that he had "made a loud
noise in the world" by the aid of his guns.</p>

<p>The first time I ever saw Washington Irving, with whom
I enjoyed an extended friendship, was when he was a
guest of Gouverneur Kemble. The intimate social relations
existing between these two friends began in early
life, and lasted throughout their careers, having been
fostered by a frequent interchange of visits. In his
earlier life Mr. Kemble inherited from his relative, Nicholas
Gouverneur, a fine old estate near Newark, New Jersey,
which bore the name of "Mount Pleasant." Washington
Irving, however, rechristened the place "Cockloft
Hall," and in a vein of mirth dubbed the bachelor-proprietor
"The Patroon." Irving described this retreat in his
"Salmagundi," and the characters there depicted which
have been thought by many to be fanciful creations were
in reality Gouverneur Kemble and his many friends. His
place was subsequently sold, but the intimacy between the
two men continued, and it has always seemed to me that
there was much pathos connected with their friendship.
Both of them were bachelors and owned homes of more
than passing historic interest on the Hudson. Irving
called Kemble's residence at Cold Spring "Bachelor's Elysium,"
while to his own he applied the name of "Wolfert's
Roost." In the spring of 1856 in writing to Kemble he
said: "I am happy to learn that your lawn is green. I
hope it will long continue so, and yourself likewise. I
shall come up one of these days and have a roll on it with
you"; and Kemble, upon another occasion, in urging
Irving to visit him added as an inducement, "come and
we will have a game of leap-frog." Referring to their last
meeting Irving said of Kemble: "That is my friend of early
life&mdash;always unchanged, always like a brother, one of the
noblest beings that ever was created. His heart is pure
gold." That was in the summer of 1859, and in the following
November Irving died, at the ripe old age of sev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>enty-six.
Constant in life, let us hope that in death they
are not separated, and that in the Silent Land</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No morrow's mischief knocks them up.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let the cynic who spurns the consoling influences of
friendship ponder upon the life-intimacy of these two old
men who, throughout the cares and turmoils of a long and
engrossing existence, illustrated so beautifully the charm
of such a benign relationship.</p>

<p>Irving impressed me as having a genial but at the same
time a retiring nature. He was of about the average
height and, although quite advanced in years when I knew
him, his hair had not changed color. His manner was exceeding
gentle and, strange to say, with such a remarkable
vocabulary at his command, in society he was exceedingly
quiet. In his early life Irving was engaged to be married
to one of his own ethereal kind, but she passed onward,
and among his friends the subject was never broached as
it seemed too sacred to dwell upon. Her name was Matilda
Hoffman and she was a daughter of the celebrated
jurist of New York, Judge Josiah Ogden Hoffman. She
died in 1809 in her eighteenth year.</p>

<p>My last meeting with Irving is vividly impressed upon
my memory as the occasion was quite memorable. I was
passing the winter in Washington as the guest of my
elder sister, Mrs. Eames, who a few years before had married
Charles Eames, Esq., of the Washington Bar. Irving,
who was then seventy-two years old, was making a brief
visit to the Capital and called to see me. This was in
1855, when William M. Thackeray was on his second visit
to this country and delivering his celebrated lectures upon
"The Four Georges." I had scarcely welcomed Mr.
Irving into my sister's drawing-room when Thackeray was
announced, and I introduced the two famous but totally
dissimilar men to each other. Thackeray was a man of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
powerful build and a very direct manner, but to my mind
was not an individual to be overpowered by sentiment.
I can not remember after the flight of so many years the
nature of the conversation between Irving and Thackeray
apart from the mutual interchange that ordinarily passes
between strangers when casually presented.</p>

<p>Later I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Thackeray
quite a number of times during his sojourn in Washington
where he was much lionized in society. One evening
we were all gathered around the family tea table when he
chanced to call and join us in that cup which is said to
cheer. He entered into conversation with much enthusiasm,
especially when he referred to his children. He
seemed to have a special admiration for a young daughter
of his, and related many pleasing anecdotes of her juvenile
aptitude. I think he referred to Anne Isabella
Thackeray (Lady Richie), who gave to the public a biographical
edition of her father's famous works. I remember
we drifted into a conversation upon a recently published
novel, but the title of the book and its author I do
not recall. At any rate, he was discussing its heroine,
who, under some extraordinary stress of circumstances,
was forced to walk many miles in her stocking-feet to obtain
succor, and the whole story was thrilling in the extreme;
whereupon the author of "Vanity Fair" exclaimed,
"She was shoeicidal." Although he was an Englishman,
he was not averse to a pun&mdash;even a poor one!
I remember asking Mr. Thackeray whether during his visit
to New York he had met Mrs. De Witt Clinton. His response
was characteristic: "Yes, and she is a gay old
girl!"</p>

<p>James K. Paulding, the distinguished author who married
the sister of Gouverneur and William Kemble and
lived at Hyde Park, farther up the Hudson, frequently
formed one of the pleasant coterie that gathered around
"Uncle Gouv's" board. "The Sage of Lindenwald," as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ex-President Martin Van Buren was frequently called by
both friend and foe, also repeatedly came from his home
in Kinderhook to dine with Mr. Kemble, and these memories
call to mind a dinner I attended at "Uncle Gouv's"
when Mr. Van Buren was the principal guest. Although
it was many years after his retirement from the presidential
office, the impression he made upon me was that
of a quiet, deliberate old gentleman, who continued to be
well versed in the affairs of state.</p>

<p>A short distance from Cold Spring is Garrison's, where
many wealthy New Yorkers have their country seats.
Putnam County, in which both Garrison's and Cold
Spring are located, was once a portion of Philipse Manor.
The house in the "Upper Manor," as this tract of land
was called, was The Grange, but over forty years ago it
was burned to the ground. It was originally built by
Captain Frederick Philips about 1800, and was the scene
of much festivity. The Philipses were tories during the
Revolution, and it is said that this property would doubtless
have been confiscated by the government but for the
fact that Mary Philips, who was Captain Frederick
Philips' only child, was a minor at the close of the war in
1783. Mary Philips, whose descendants have spelled the
name with a final <i>e</i>, married Samuel Gouverneur, and
their eldest son, Frederick Philipse Gouverneur, dropped
the name Gouverneur as a surname and assumed that of
Philipse in order to inherit a large landed estate of which
The Grange was a conspicuous part.</p>

<p>When I first visited Garrison's the Philipse family was
living at The Grange in great elegance. Frederick
Philipse was then a bachelor and his maiden sister, Mary
Marston Gouverneur, presided over his establishment.
Another sister, Margaret Philipse Gouverneur, married
William Moore, a son of the beloved physician, Dr. William
Moore of New York, a nephew of President Benjamin
Moore of Columbia College and a first cousin of Clement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
C. Moore who wrote the oft quoted verses, "'Twas the
Night before Christmas," which have delighted the hearts
of American children for so many decades.</p>

<p>Frederick Philipse subsequently married Catharine
Wadsworth Post, a member of a prominent family of New
York. It was while Mr. and Mrs. Philipse were visiting
her relatives that The Grange was destroyed by fire. Miss
Mary Marston Gouverneur had ordered the chimneys
cleaned, in the manner then prevalent, by making a fire
in the chimney place on the first floor, in order to burn out
the d&eacute;bris. The flames fortunately broke out on the top
story, thus enabling members of the family to save many
valuable heirlooms in the lower apartments. Among the
paintings rescued and now in the possession of Frederick
Philipse's daughters, the Misses Catharine Wadsworth
Philipse and Margaret Gouverneur Philipse of New York,
was the portrait of the pretty Mary Philipse, Washington's
first love. Tradition states she refused his offer of marriage
to become the bride of Roger Morris, an officer in the
British Army. It is generally believed that she was the
heroine of Cooper's "Spy;" but she had then laid aside
the belleship of early youth and had become the intellectual
matron of after years. Some of the other portraits rescued
were those of Adolphus Philipse, second son of the
first Lord of the Manor; Philip Philipse, and his wife, Margaret
Marston, whose second husband was the Rev. John
Ogilvie, for many years assistant minister of Trinity
Church of New York; Margaret Philipse, younger sister of
Mary, who married Roger Morris; Captain Frederick
Philips, by Gilbert Stuart; Mrs. Samuel Gouverneur; Nathaniel
Marston and his wife, Mary Crooke; and Mrs.
Abraham Gouverneur who was the daughter of Jacob
Leisler, at one time the Acting Governor of the Province
of New York.</p>

<p>One visit I made to the Philipses at Garrison's is
especially fresh in my memory, as Eleanor Jones Duer, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
daughter of President William A. Duer of Columbia College,
who subsequently married George T. Wilson of
Georgia, was their guest at the same time. She was a
woman of much culture and refinement, and in every way
a delightful companion. A great intimacy existed for
many years between the Gouverneurs and Philipses of
Garrison's and the Duer family of New York. The Philipses,
who at this time lived very much in the old-fashioned
style, were the last of the old families with which I
was familiar to have the cloth removed after the dessert
was served; and in doing this an elegant mahogany table
always kept in a highly polished condition was displayed.
Upon it were placed the fruits, nuts and wine. Another
custom in the Philipse family which, as far as I know,
was unique in this country was that of having four meals
a day. Breakfast was served at eight, luncheon at one,
dinner at six and supper at nine o'clock.</p>

<p>During another visit I made at The Grange I had the
pleasure of meeting Mr. and Mrs. Henry Sheaffe Hoyt
(Frances Maria Duer), who were house guests there and
who had just returned from an extended European tour.
She was another daughter of President Duer of Columbia
College and died not long ago in Newport, R.I., at a very
advanced age. Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer, a daughter
of Mrs. Archibald Gracie King (Elizabeth Denning
Duer), is her niece.</p>

<p>Before leaving the banks of the Hudson River I must
speak of my former associations with Newburgh. From
my earliest life we children were in the habit of making
frequent visits to my mother's relatives, the Roe family,
who resided there. We all eagerly looked forward to these
trips up the Hudson which were made upon the old <i>Thomas
Powell</i> and later upon the <i>Mary Powell</i>. My mother's
relative, Maria Hazard, married William Roe, one of the
most highly respected and prosperous citizens of Newburgh.
They lived in a stately mansion surrounded by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
several acres of land in the heart of the city. Mrs. Roe
was a remarkable woman. I knew her only as an elderly
matron; but, like women of advanced age in China, where
I spent a number of years of my early married life, she
controlled everyone who came within her "sphere of influence."
I remember, for example, that upon one occasion
when I was visiting her, Thomas Hazard Roe, her
elder son, who at the time was over sixty years of age
and a bachelor and who desired to go upon some hunting
expedition, said to her: "Mother, have I your permission
to go to the Adirondacks?" She thought for a few moments
and replied: "Well, Hazard, I think you might go."</p>

<p>About the year 1840 Newburgh was recommended by
two of the earliest prominent homeopathic physicians of
New York City, Doctors John F. Gray and Amos G. Hull,
as a locality well-adapted to people affected with delicate
lungs, and upon their advice many families built handsome
residences there. In my early recollection Newburgh
had a fine hotel called the Powelton, which bade
fair to become a prominent resort for New Yorkers.
In the zenith of its prosperity, however, it was burned to
the ground and was never rebuilt. I hardly think that
anyone will have the assurance to dispute the healthfulness
of this place when I state that my cousin, Thomas
Hazard Roe, of whom I have just spoken, died there in
1907 after having more than rounded a full century of
years. He was in many ways a remarkable man with a
mind well stored with knowledge, and he retained all of
his mental faculties unclouded until the end of his life.
His sister, Mary Elizabeth, the widow of the late William
C. Hasbrouck, a prominent Newburgh lawyer and a few
years his junior, also died quite recently in Newburgh at
the age of ninety-seven. Her son, General Henry C. Hasbrouck,
U.S.A., also died but a short time since, but her
daughter, Miss Maria Hasbrouck, whose whole life has been
devoted to her family, still resides in the old homestead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The third and youngest member of this interesting trio,
Miss Emily Maria Roe, is now living in Newburgh at an
advanced age, surrounded by a large connection and beloved
by everyone.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent families in Newburgh in
years gone by was that of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Powell,
from whom the celebrated river boats were named. Mrs.
Powell's maiden name was Mary Ludlow, and she belonged
to a well-known New York family. Her brother, Lieutenant
Augustus C. Ludlow, who was second in command
on board the <i>Chesapeake</i>, under Captain James Lawrence
of "Don't give up the ship" fame, is buried by the latter's
side in old Trinity church-yard in New York. Mrs.
Powell took great pride and pleasure in the boat named
in her honor, the <i>Mary Powell</i>, and I have frequently seen
her upon my trips up the Hudson, sitting upon the deck
of her namesake and chatting pleasantly with those around
her.</p>

<p>Newburgh was also the home of Andrew Jackson Downing,
the author of "Landscape Gardening," "Cottage
Residences," and other similar works. I received my first
knowledge of horticulture from a visit I made to his beautiful
residence, which was surrounded by several acres.
It was my earliest view of nature assisted by art, and to
my untutored eye his lawn was a veritable Paradise.
Some years later, when I was visiting the Scotts in Washington,
Mr. Downing called and during our conversation
told me that he had come to the Capital, upon the invitation
of the government, to lay out the Smithsonian
grounds. His wife was Miss Caroline De Wint of Fishkill,
New York, a granddaughter of Mrs. Henry William
Smith (Abigail Adams), the only daughter of President
John Adams who reached maturity. After spending some
months in Washington, Mr. Downing was returning to
his Newburgh home when the <i>Henry Clay</i>, a Hudson
River steamboat upon which he had taken passage, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
destroyed by fire and he perished while attempting to
rescue some of the passengers. This was in 1852.</p>

<p>There are some persons still living who will readily recall,
in connection with social functions, the not uncommon
name of Brown. The particular Brown to whom I
refer was the sexton of Grace Episcopal Church, on the
corner of Broadway and Tenth Street, where many of the
<i>soi-disant cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me</i> worshiped. He must have
possessed a christian name, but if so I never heard it for
he was only plain Brown, and Brown he was called. He
was born before the days when spurious genealogical
charts are thrust at one, <i>nolens volens</i>; but probably this
was lucky for him and the public was spared much that
is uninteresting. In connection with his duties at Grace
Church he came in contact with many fashionable people,
and was enabled to add materially to his rather small income
by calling carriages from the doorsteps for the society
folk of the great metropolis. In this and other ways his
pursuits gradually became so varied that in time he might
have been safely classed among the <i>dilettanti</i>. The most
remarkable feature of his career, however, was the fact
that, in spite of his humble calling, he became a veritable
social dictator, and many an ambitious mother with a thousand-dollar
ball upon her hands (this being about the
usual sum spent upon an evening entertainment at that
time), lacked the courage to embark upon such a venture
without first seeking an interview with Brown. I knew
but little about his powers of discrimination, as we as a
family never found his services necessary, but when requested
I know he furnished to these dependent hostesses
lists of eligible young men whom he deemed proficient in
the polka and mazurka, the fashionable dances of the day.
Strange as it may appear, I can vouch for the truth of
the statement that many an exclusive hostess was glad to
avail herself of these lists of the accommodating Brown.
The dances just mentioned were, by the way, introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
into this country by Pierro Saracco, an Italian master
who taught me to dance, and who was quite popular in the
fashionable circles of his day. Many years later, when
I was residing in Maryland, he came to Frederick several
times a week and gave dancing lessons to my two older
daughters.</p>

<p>Brown was a pleasant, genial, decidedly "hail-fellow-well-met"
man, as I remember him, and was in a way
the precursor of Ward McAllister, though of course on a
decidedly more unpretentious plane. One cannot but express
surprise at the consideration with which Brown's
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> were treated by the <i>&eacute;lite</i>, nor can one deny that
the social destinies of many young men were the direct
result of his strenuous efforts. I remember, for example,
one of these who at the time was "a youth to fortune and
to fame unknown," whom Brown took under his sheltering
wing and whose subsequent social career was shaped
by him. He is of foreign birth, with a pleasing exterior
and address and, through the instrumentality of his humble
friend who gave him his first start, is to-day, although
advanced in life, one of the most conspicuous financiers
in New York, and occasionally has private audiences with
presidents and other magnates. Moreover, I feel certain
that he will welcome this humble tribute to his benefactor
with much delight, as the halo which now surrounds his
brow he owes in a large degree to his early introduction
into the smart set by the sexton of Grace Church. The
last I ever heard of Brown, he visited Europe. After his
return from his well-earned holiday he died and was laid
to rest in his own native soil. Peace to Brown's ashes&mdash;his
work was well done! It cannot be said of him, as of
many others, that he lived in vain, as he was doubtless
the forerunner of the later and more accomplished leader
and dictator of New York's "Four Hundred."</p>

<p>A poetaster paid him the following facetious tribute:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, glorious Brown, thou medley strange<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of churchyard, ballroom, saint, and sinner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flying by morn through fashion's range<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And burying mortals after dinner.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walking one day with invitations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing the next at consecrations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossing the sod at eve on coffins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one hand drying tears of orphans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one unclasping ballroom carriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or cutting plumcake up for marriage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dusting by day the pew and missal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounding by night the ballroom whistle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admitted free through fashion's wicket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And skilled at psalms, at punch, and cricket.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An amusing anecdote is told of Brown's financial <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>
whose name I have withheld. When he was still
somewhat uncertain of his social status he received an invitation
to a fancy ball given by a fashionable matron.
This recognition he regarded as a conspicuous social triumph,
and in his desire to do the proper thing he sought
William R. Travers&mdash;"Bill Travers," as he was generally
called&mdash;to ask his advice in regard to the proper costume
for him to wear. The inquiring social aspirant had a
head well-denuded of hair, and Mr. Travers, after a moment's
hesitation, wittingly replied: "Sugarcoat your
head and go as a pill!"</p>

<p>Though not a professional wit, Brown was at least capable
of making a pun quite equal to those inflicted upon
society by some of his superiors. As sexton of Grace
Church, he officiated at the wedding of Miss Phoebe Lord,
a daughter of Daniel Lord, whose marriage to Henry Day,
a rising young lawyer, was solemnized in this edifice. At
the close of the reception following the marriage ceremony
someone laughingly called upon Brown for a toast. He
was equal to the occasion as he quickly replied: "This is
the Lord's Day!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>FASHION AND LETTERS</h3>


<p>One of the show places of New York State, many
years ago, was the residence of John Greig, a
polished Scotch gentleman who presided with
dignity over his princely estate in Canandaigua in central
New York, and there dispensed a generous hospitality.
Mr. Greig was the agent for some of the English nobility,
many of whom owned extensive tracts of land in America.
The village of Canandaigua was also the home of the
Honorable Francis Granger, a son of Gideon Granger,
Postmaster General under Jefferson and Madison. Francis
Granger was the Postmaster General for a brief
period under President William Henry Harrison, but the
latter died soon after his inauguration and his successor
did not retain him in his cabinet. It is said of Francis
Granger that he was a firm believer in the words of ex-Governor
William L. Marcy in the United States Senate in
1832 that "to the victors belong the spoils of the enemy,"
and that during his month of cabinet service eighteen
hundred employees in his department were dismissed.
The Democrats evidently thought that "turn about was
fair play," as a few years later, under President Polk,
the work of decapitation was equally active. Ransom H.
Gillett, Register of the Treasury at that time, became so
famous at head-chopping, that he was soon nicknamed
"Guillotine."</p>

<p>Mr. Granger, with his fine physique and engaging manner
(he was often called "the handsome Frank Granger"),
was well adapted to the requirements of social life and
especially to those of the National Capital, where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<i>beaux esprits</i> usually congregated. His only daughter,
Adele Granger, often called "the witty Miss Granger,"
was at school at Madame Chegaray's with my elder sister
Fanny, and in my earlier life was frequently a guest in
our Houston Street home, prior to her sojourn in Washington,
where her father for many years represented his
district in Congress. We looked forward to her visits as
one anticipates with delight a ray of sunshine. She was
always assured of the heartiest of welcomes in Washington,
where she was the center of a bright and intellectual
circle. She finally married Mr. John E. Thayer, a Boston
capitalist, and after his death became the wife of the
Hon. Robert C. Winthrop of the same city. She presided
with grace over a summer home in Brookline and a winter
residence in Boston, at both of which she received hosts
of distinguished guests. To illustrate the importance
with which she was regarded, one of her guests remarked
to me, during one of my visits at the Brookline home, that
Mrs. Winthrop was more than one woman&mdash;that in that
locality she was considered an "institution." In the latter
part of Mr. Winthrop's life I received a very graceful
note from him enclosing the following ode written by him
in honor of the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria:</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">Robert C. Winthrop.</span></p>

<p>Boston, June, 1887.</p>
</div>

<p>At Geneseo, in the beautiful Genesee Valley, and a few
miles from Canandaigua, in one of the most fertile portions
of the State of New York, resided a contemporary
and friend of Mrs. Robert C. Winthrop, Miss Elizabeth
Wadsworth, a daughter of James Wadsworth, a well-known
philanthropist and one of the wealthiest landed
proprietors in the state. He was also the father of Major
General James S. Wadsworth, a defeated candidate for
Governor of New York, who was killed in 1864 at the battle
of the Wilderness. Miss Wadsworth was celebrated
for her grace of manner. I had the pleasure of knowing
her quite well in New York, where she generally passed
her winters. Quite early in life and before the period
when the fair daughters of America had discovered, to
any great extent, the advantages of matrimonial alliances
with foreign <i>partis</i>, she married the Honorable Charles
Augustus Murray, a member of the English Parliament
and of a Scotch family, the head of which was the Earl
of Dunmore. She lived but a few years, and died in
Egypt, where her husband was Consul General, leaving
a young son. Her husband's ancestor, John Murray, Lord
Dunmore, was the last Colonial Governor of Virginia. It
has been asserted that but few, if any, Colonial Governors,
not even the sportive Lord Cornbury of New York who,
upon state occasions, dressed himself up in female attire
in compliment to his royal cousin, Queen Anne, had quite
as eventful a career. Lord Dunmore originally came to
America as Governor of the Province of New York, but
was subsequently transferred to Virginia. While in New
York he was made President of the St. Andrew's Society,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a Scotch organization which had been in existence about
twenty years and whose first President was Philip Livingston,
the Signer. In an old New York directory of
1798 I find the following names of officers of this society
for the preceding year: Walter Ruturfurde (sic), President;
Peter M'Dougall and George Turnbull, Vice Presidents;
George Douglass, Treasurer; George Johnson, Secretary;
John Munro, Assistant Secretary; the Rev. John
M. Mason and the Rev. John Bisset, Chaplains; Dr. James
Tillary, Physician; and William Renwick, James Stuart,
John Knox, Alexander Thomson, Andrew D. Barclay, and
John M'Gregor, Managers.</p>

<p>It was not at all flattering to the pride of Virginia that
Lord Dunmore lingered so long in New York after his
order of transfer to the Old Dominion. He also greatly
incurred the displeasure of the Virginians by occasionally
dissolving their Assembly, and they found him generally
inimical to their interests. Finally matters were brought
to an issue, and Dunmore, in defense of his conduct,
issued a proclamation against "a certain Patrick Henry
and his deluded followers." His final act was the burning
of Norfolk in 1776, which at that time was the most
flourishing city in Virginia. During Lord Dunmore's life
in Colonial Virginia, a daughter was born to him and
at the request of the Assembly was named "Virginia." It
is said that subsequently a provision was made by the
Provincial Legislature, by virtue of which she was to receive
a very large sum of money when she became of age.
Meanwhile, the War of the Revolution severed the yoke
of Great Britain, and Lord Dunmore returned to England
with his family. Time passed and the little girl born in
the Virginia colony grew into womanhood. Her father
had died and as her circumstances became contracted she
addressed a letter to Thomas Jefferson, then President of
the United States, under the impression that he was Governor
of Virginia. Jefferson sent the letter to James Mon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>roe,
who was then Governor of Virginia, and he in turn
referred it to the Legislature of that State. This letter
is now in my possession and is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir:</p>

<p>I am at a loss how to begin a letter in which I am desirous
of stating claims that many long years have been
forgotten, but which I think no time can really annihilate
until fulfilment has followed the promise. I imagine that
you must have heard that during my father Dunmore's
residence in America I was born and that the Assembly,
then sitting at Williamsburg, requested that I might be
their God-daughter and christened by the name of Virginia;
which request being complied with, they purposed
providing for me in a manner suitable to the honor they
conferred upon me and to the responsibility they had
taken on themselves. I was accordingly christened as the
God-daughter of that Assembly and named after the State.
Events have since occurred which in some measure may
have altered the intentions then expressed in my favor.
These were (so I have understood) that a sum of money
should be settled upon me which, accumulating during my
minority, would make up the sum of one hundred thousand
pounds when I became of age. It is true many
changes may have taken place in America, but that
fact still remains the same. I am still the God-daughter
of the Virginians. By being that, may I not flatter
myself I have some claims upon their benevolence
if not upon their justice? May I not ask that State,
especially you, sir, their Governor, to fulfil in some respects
the engagements entered into by their predecessors?
Your fathers promised mine that I should become their
charge. I am totally unprovided for; for my father died
without making a will. My brothers are married, having
families of their own; and not being bound to do anything
for me, they regard with indifference my unprotected and
neglected situation. Perhaps I ought not to mention this
circumstance as a proper inducement for you to act upon;
nor would I, were it not my excuse for wishing to remind
you of the claims I now advance. I hope you will feel my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
right to your favor and protection to be founded on the
promises made by your own fathers, and in the situation
in which I stand with regard to the State of Virginia.
You will ask, sir, why my appeal to your generosity and
justice has been so tardy. While my father lived, I lived
under his protection and guidance. He had incurred the
displeasure of the Virginians and he feared an application
from me would have seemed like one from him. At
his decease I became a free agent. I had taken no part
which could displease my God-fathers, and myself remained
what the Assembly had made me&mdash;their God-daughter,
consequently their charge. I wish particularly
to enforce my dependence upon your bounty; for I feel
hopes revive, which owe their birth to your honor and
generosity, and to that of the State whose representative
I now address. Now that my father is no more, I am certain
they and you will remember what merited your esteem
in his character and conduct and forget that which
estranged your hearts from so honorable a man. But
should you not, you are too just to visit what you deem
the sins of the father upon his luckless daughter.</p>

<p class='indent3'>I am, sir, your obt. etc.</p></div>

<p>In 1831 the small but pretty Gramercy Park in New
York was established by Samuel B. Ruggles. I have
heard that this plot of ground was originally used as a
burying ground by Trinity parish. As I first recollect
the spot, there were but four or five dwellings in its vicinity.
One of the earliest was built by James W.
Gerard, a prominent lawyer, who was regarded as a most
venturesome pioneer to establish his residence in such a
remote locality. Next door to Mr. Gerard, a few years later,
lived George Belden, whose daughter Julia married Frederick
S. Tallmadge. Mr. Tallmadge died only a few years ago,
highly respected and esteemed by a large circle of friends.</p>

<p>In 1846 I was one of the guests at a fashionable wedding
in a residence on the west side of this park, which
was possibly the first ceremony of the kind to take place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in this then remote region. The bride's mother, the
widow of Richard Armistead of New Bern, N.C., who
habitually spent her winters in New York, had purchased
the house only a few months previously. The bride,
Susan Armistead, was an intimate friend of mine, and a
well-known belle in both the North and the South. The
groom, a resident of New York, was John Still Winthrop,
of the same family as the Winthrops of Massachusetts.
The guests composed an interesting assemblage of the old
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>, many of whose descendants are now in the background.
I met on that occasion many old friends, among
whom the Kings, Gracies, Winthrops and Rogers predominated.
Mrs. De Witt Clinton honored the occasion,
dressed in the fashion of a decade or two previous. Her
presence was a very graceful act as she then but seldom
appeared in society, her only view of the gay world being
from her own domain. Her peculiarity in regard to dress
was very marked as she positively declined to change it
with the prevailing style but clung tenaciously to the old-fashioned
<i>modes</i> to the end of her life. Miss Armistead
was an ideal-looking bride in her white dress and long
tulle veil and carried, according to the custom then prevalent,
a large flat bouquet of white japonicas with white
lace paper around the stems. In the dining-room, a handsome
collation was served, with a huge wedding cake at
one end of the table and pomegranates, especially sent
from the bride's southern home, forming a part of the
repast. The health of the newly wedded couple was
drunk in champagne and good cheer prevailed on every
side. The whole house bore a happy aspect with its floral
decorations and its bright Liverpool coal fires burning in
the grates. Furnaces, by the way, were then unknown.
In New York there was at that time a strong prejudice
against anthracite coal, and Liverpool coal was therefore
generally used, the price of which was fifteen dollars a
ton. I have many close and tender associations connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
with this bride of so many years ago, especially as our
friendship, formed in our early life, still extends to
her descendants. Some years after Mrs. Winthrop's
marriage, and in her earlier widowhood, four generations
traveled together, and then, as at other times,
dwelt under the same roof. They were Mrs. Nathaniel
Smith, Mrs. Richard Armistead, Mrs. John S. Winthrop
and her son, John S. Winthrop, who, with his interesting
family, now resides in Tallahassee.</p>

<p>In 1841, Lord Morpeth, the seventh Earl of Carlisle and
a worthy specimen of the English nobility, visited the
United States, and while here investigated the subject of
the inheritance of slaves by English subjects. His report
seems to have been favorably received, as a law was passed
subsequent to his return declaring it illegal for Englishmen
to hold slaves through inheritance. England's sympathetic
heart about this time was in a perennial throb
for "the poor Africans in chains," apparently quite oblivious
to the fact that the "chains" had been introduced
and cemented by her fostering hand.</p>

<p>I recall with unusual pleasure an entertainment where
Lord Morpeth was the guest of honor, at the residence of
William Bard on College Place, at that time a fashionable
street in the vicinity of old Columbia College. I have
always remembered the occasion as I was then introduced
to Lord Morpeth and enjoyed a long and pleasant conversation
with him. Our host was a son of Dr. Samuel Bard,
physician to General Washington during the days when
New York was the seat of government.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. John Austin Stevens lived on Bleecker
Street and had a number of interesting daughters. They
were an intellectual family and I attended an entertainment
given by them in honor of Martin Farquhar Tupper,
the author of "Proverbial Philosophy." Mr. Stevens'
sister, Lucretia Ledyard Stevens, married Mr. Richard
Heckscher of Philadelphia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Another gentlewoman of the same period was Mrs.
Laura Wolcott Gibbs, wife of Colonel George Gibbs of
Newport. The first Oliver Wolcott, a Signer, Governor of
Connecticut and General in the Revolutionary War, was
her grandfather; while the second of the same name,
Secretary of the Treasury under Washington and Adams,
Governor of his State and United States Judge, was her
father. I am in the fullest sympathy with the following
remarks concerning her made at her funeral by the Rev.
Dr. Henry W. Bellows: "I confess I always felt in the
presence of Mrs. Gibbs as if I were talking with Oliver
Wolcott himself, and saw in her self-reliant, self-asserting
and independent manner and speech an unmistakable
copy of a strong and thoroughly individual character,
forged in the hottest fires of national struggle. The intense
individuality of her nature set her apart from others.
You felt that from the womb she must have been just
what she was&mdash;a piece of the original granite on which the
nation was built.... The force, the courage, the self-poise
she exhibited in the ordinary concerns of our peaceful
life would in a masculine frame have made, in times
of national peril, a patriot of the most decided and energetic
character&mdash;one able and willing to believe all things
possible, and to make all the efforts and sacrifices by which
impossibilities are accomplished."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibbs was literally steeped and moulded in the
traditions of the past; in fact, she was a reminder of the
noble women of the Revolutionary era, many of whom
have left records behind them. She was gifted with a
keen sense of humor, and her talent in repartee was proverbial.
Although many years my senior, I found delightful
companionship in her society, and her home was always
a great resource to me. Her accomplished daughter,
the wife of Captain Theophile d'Oremieulx, U.S.A.,
was particularly skilled in music. Her son, Wolcott
Gibbs, the distinguished Professor of Harvard University,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
maintained to the last the high intellectual standard of
his ancestors. He died several years ago. I was informed
by his mother that at one period of its history Columbia
College desired to secure his services as a professor, but
that the Hon. Hamilton Fish, one of its trustees and an
uncompromising Episcopalian, objected on the ground of
his Unitarian faith and was sustained by the Board of
Trustees. It seemed a rather inconsistent act, as at another
period of its history a Hebrew was chosen as a member
of the same faculty.</p>

<p>As nearly as I can remember, it was in the summer of
1845 that I spent several weeks as the guest of the
financier and author, Alexander B. Johnson, in Utica,
New York. Mrs. Johnson's maiden name was Abigail
Louisa Smith Adams, and she was the daughter of Charles
Adams, son of President John Adams. During my sojourn
there her uncle, John Quincy Adams, came to Utica
to visit his relatives, and I had the pleasure of being a
guest of the family at the same time. He was accompanied
upon this trip by his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Charles
Francis Adams, a young grandson whose name I do not
recall, and the father of Mrs. Adams, Peter C. Brooks, of
Boston, another of whose daughters was the wife of Edward
Everett. Upon their arrival in Utica, the greatest
enthusiasm prevailed, and the elderly ex-President was
welcomed by an old-fashioned torchlight procession. In
response to many urgent requests, Mr. Adams made an
impromptu speech from the steps of the Johnson house,
and proved himself to be indeed "the old man eloquent."
Although he was not far from eighty years old, he was
by no means lacking in either mental or physical vitality.
Mrs. Charles Francis Adams impressed me as a woman of
unusual culture and intellectuality, while her father, Peter
C. Brooks, was a genial old gentleman whom everyone
loved to greet. He was at that time one of Boston's millionaires;
and many years later I heard his grandson, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
late Henry Sidney Everett, of Washington, son of Edward
Everett, say of him that when he first arrived in
Boston he was a youth with little or no means.</p>

<p>After the Adams party had rested for a few days a
pleasure trip to Trenton Falls, in Oneida County, was
proposed. A few prominent citizens of Utica were invited
by the Johnsons to accompany the party, and
among them several well-known lawyers whose careers won
for them a national as well as local reputation. Among
these I may especially mention the handsome Horatio Seymour,
then in his prime, whose courteous manners and
manly bearing made him exceptionally attractive. Mr.
Adams bore the fatigue of the trip remarkably well and
his strength seemed undiminished as the day waned.
His devoted daughter-in-law remained constantly beside
him while at the Falls to administer to his comfort and
attend to his wants; in fact, she was so solicitous concerning
him that she requested that she might, in going and
coming, occupy a carriage as near him as possible. I cannot
but regard her as a model for many of the present
generation who fail to be deeply impressed by either merit
or years.</p>

<p>The Adamses were charming guests, and I have always
felt that I was highly privileged to visit under the
same roof with them, and especially to listen to the words
of wisdom of the venerable ex-President. I have heard
it stated, by the way, that during his official life in Washington,
Mr. Adams took a daily bath in the Potomac.
This luxury he must have missed in Utica, as at this time
it offered no opportunities for a plunge except in the
"raging canal." Mrs. Charles Francis Adams accompanied
her husband when he went to England, during our
Civil War, to represent the United States at the Court of
St. James. The consummate manner in which he conducted
our relations with Great Britain at that critical
period marked him as an accomplished statesman and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
diplomatist of the rarest skill. The nature of his task
was one of extreme delicacy, and it is highly probable that,
but for his masterly efforts, England would have recognized
the independence of the Southern Confederacy.
The energy and fidelity with which he met the requirements
of his mission undermined his health and, returning
to this country, he retired to his old home in
Quincy.</p>

<p>While in Utica I drove in the family carriage with Mrs.
Johnson and her sister, Mrs. John W. King, to Peterboro,
about twenty-five miles distant, to visit Mr. and Mrs.
Gerrit Smith. Mr. Smith had already commenced his
crusade against slavery, and the family antipathy to the
institution was so strong that two of his nieces, sisters of
General John Cochrane, who later became President of the
Society of the Cincinnati, refused to wear dresses made of
cotton because it was a Southern staple. As I remember
this great anti-slavery agitator, he was a remarkably handsome
man with an air of enthusiasm which seemed to pervade
his whole being. From 1853 to 1855 he was in Congress,
and I had the pleasure of listening to one of his
scathing speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives
in denunciation of slavery. I recall his unusual felicity
in the use of Scriptural quotations, one of which
still lingers in my ears: "Where the spirit of the Lord
is there is liberty." His daughter Elizabeth married
Charles Dudley Miller, a prominent citizen of Utica. She
was a woman of very pronounced views, as may be judged,
in part, by the fact that some years after my marriage,
and while living in Washington, I met her by accident
one day at the Capitol and to my surprise discovered that
she was wearing bloomers!</p>

<p>In September, 1849, I was returning to my home in
New York from another visit to the Johnsons in Utica,
when, upon the invitation of Mrs. Hamilton Fish, whose
husband was then Governor of the Empire State, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
stopped in Albany and visited them. They were of course
occupying the gubernatorial mansion, but its exact location
I cannot exactly recall. Life was exceedingly simple
in the middle of the last century, even in the wealthiest
families, and through all these years I seem to remember
but a single incident connected with the family life of
these early friends&mdash;the trivial fact that the breakfast
hour was seven o'clock. Mrs. Fish was a model mother
and was surrounded by a large and interesting family of
children, some of whom are among the highly prominent
people of the present time.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of the Fish children, an amusing story is told
of the keen sense of humor of the late William M. Evarts,
who presented in every-day life such a stern exterior.
When, on one occasion, he was a guest of the Fish family
at their summer home on the Hudson, his attention was
called to a large and beautifully executed painting of a
group of children which, as was quite apparent, was
greatly treasured by the ex-Governor. Mr. Evarts gazed
upon the portrait for some minutes in silence and then
exclaimed in a low tone, "little Fishes." Mr. Fish stood
near his guest but, not catching the exact drift of his remark,
replied: "Sir, I do not understand." The bright
response was: "Yes, I said little fishes, <i>sardines</i>,"&mdash;reminding
one of Artemus Ward's definition of sardines,
"little fishes biled in ile."</p>

<p>Another witticism of Mr. Evarts's which seems to me
deserving of preservation is said to have been uttered
during his residence in Washington, when he was Secretary
of State under President Hayes. A party of distinguished
Englishmen was visiting the National Capital and
Mr. Evarts escorted it to Mount Vernon. After inspecting
the mansion and the grave of Washington the party
walked to the end of the lawn to view the attractive scenery
of the Potomac River. One of the Englishmen who
seemed decidedly more conversant with certain phases of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
American history than the others asked Mr. Evarts
whether it were really true that Washington could throw
a shilling across the Potomac. "Yes," said Mr. Evarts,
in a diplomatic tone, "it is quite true." The same evening
at a dinner, the Secretary of State repeated the conversation
to a mutual friend and added: "He could do
even better than that; he could toss a Sovereign across
the Atlantic!"</p>

<p>The day after my arrival in Albany, President Zachary
Taylor and his suite were the guests of Governor and Mrs.
Fish, and the same day a dinner was given in his honor
which was attended by prominent State officials. Meanwhile,
a concourse of people had surrounded the mansion,
anxious to see the President and to demand a speech.
Old "Rough and Ready" appeared at an open window
and faced the multitude, but was not as "ready" in
speech as with his sword. He made a brave attempt, however,
to gratify the people, but he seemed exceedingly
feeble and his voice was decidedly weak. In the course
of his remarks his aide and son-in-law, Colonel William W.
S. Bliss, came to his rescue and prompted him, as it were,
from behind the scenes; so that everything passed off, as
I understood the next day, to the satisfaction of his audience.
Possibly this was one of Taylor's last appearances
in public, as he died the following summer.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Fish was at this time a comparatively
young woman, she presided over the Governor's mansion
with the same grace and ease so characteristic of her
career in Washington when her husband was Secretary of
State under President Grant. In my opinion, and I
know but few who had a better opportunity of judging,
Mrs. Fish was in many respects a remarkable woman.
For eight years her home was a social center, and
she was regarded as the social dictator of the Grant administration.
When any perplexing questions of a social
nature arose during her <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, the general inquiry was:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
"What does Mrs. Fish say?" This in time became a
standing joke, but it illustrates the fact that her decisions
usually were regarded as final.</p>

<p>One of the social leaders in New York during my
younger life was Mrs. Isaac Jones, who, in her own set,
was known as "Bloody Mary." Why this name was applied
to her I cannot say, as she was not in the least
either cruel or revengeful, as far as I knew, but on the
contrary was suave and genial to an unusual degree. She
lived on Broadway, directly opposite the site where the
New York Hotel formerly stood, and her entertainments
were both numerous and elaborate. She was one of the
daughters of John Mason, who began life as a tailor but
left at his death an estate valued at a million dollars,
which was a large fortune for those days. Isaac Jones
was president of the Chemical Manufacturing Company
and later became prominently connected with the Chemical
Bank of New York. A brother of Mrs. Jones married
Miss Emma Wheatley, a superior young woman who,
unfortunately for her father-in-law's peace of mind, was
an actress. This alliance was most distasteful to the whole
Mason connection, and when John Mason was approaching
death George W. Strong, a prominent lawyer, was
hastily summoned by his daughters to draft his will. Almost
immediately following Mr. Mason's funeral a legal
battle was commenced over his estate. He left outright
to his three daughters their proportionate share of his
fortune, but to his son who had displeased him by his
marriage he devised an annuity of only fifteen hundred
dollars. Charles O'Conor, the counsel for the son, in his
argument in behalf of his client, said that Mr. Mason's
daughters, instead of sending for a clergyman to console
his dying moments, had demanded the immediate presence
of a respectable lawyer, "a lawyer so respectable
that throughout his entire practice he never had a poor
client." Mr. O'Conor succeeded in breaking this will,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and young Mason was given his proper share in his father's
estate.</p>

<p>One of John Mason's daughters became the wife of
Gordon Hammersley, whose son Louis married the beautiful
Miss Lilly Warren Price of Troy, the daughter of
Commodore Cicero Price of the United States Navy.
She subsequently married the Duke of Marlborough, and
afterwards Lord William Beresford. The Marlborough-Hammersley
ceremony was performed in this country by
a justice of the peace, and the new Duchess of Marlborough
went to England to live upon her husband's depleted
estates. It is said that she was allowed by her late husband's
family an annual income of one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars; and Blenheim, which had long felt the
strain of "decay's effacing fingers," began again, through
the agency of the Hammersley wealth, to resemble the
structure once occupied by that tyrant of royalty, the imperious
Sarah Jennings.</p>

<p>Very little seemed to be known about Louis Hammersley,
as he lived a retired life, and when seen in public was almost
invariably accompanied by his father, Gordon Hammersley.
When the two appeared upon the street, they
were sometimes facetiously dubbed "Dombey and Son."
They were familiar figures on Broadway, where they invariably
walked arm in arm. John Hammersley, a
brother of Gordon, was the &aelig;sthetic member of this well-known
family. One of his pet diversions was the giving
of unusual, and sometimes sensational, dinners. To celebrate
the completion of the trans-continental railroad, he
planned what he called a Roman dinner. His guests were
furnished with togas and partook of the meal in a reclining
position, like the Romans of old. This unique entertainment
was, of course, thoroughly enjoyed, but did not
become <i>&agrave; la mode</i> as the flowing toga could hardly compete
with trim waistcoats and clinging trousers, even on
festive occasions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Fifty years ago, more or less, a house was erected in
New York on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and
Fifteenth Street by Mrs. Charles Maverick Parker, and,
to the astonishment of Gothamites, it was said to have
cost one hundred thousand dollars! Later it became the
home of the Manhattan Club. Many old residents visited
it on its completion, as such a costly structure was regarded
with nothing short of amazement. I remember it
was an <i>on dit</i> of the town that upon one occasion, when
Mrs. Parker was personally escorting some unusually
prominent person through the mansion, she pointed to a
pretty little receptacle in her bedroom and exclaimed as
she passed: "That is where I keep my old shoes. I wear
old shoes just as other people do." The cost and pretentiousness
of her establishment caused her to be nicknamed
"Mrs. House Parker." Her residence was built
of brown stone, which so strongly appealed to the taste
of New Yorkers that in time the same material was
largely employed in the erection of dwellings. High ceilings
were then much in vogue and were greatly admired.
In our house in Houston Street, where I passed my late
childhood and early womanhood, the ceilings were unusually
high, while all of the doors were of massive mahogany
set in ornamental white frames. In subsequent years
I met so many persons who in former days had been our
neighbors in Houston Street that I was conceited enough
to designate that locality as "the cradle of the universe."
Anthony Bleecker Neilson was our next-door neighbor in
this famous old street, and during my life in China twin
sons of his, William and Bleecker, were again my neighbors
in Foo Chow, where they were both employed in the
<i>Hong</i> (firm) of Oliphant &amp; Company.</p>

<p>A rival to Mrs. Parker's fine house was not long in appearing.
Directly opposite a stately residence was built
by Mrs. Richard K. Haight which subsequently became
the New York Club. A great rivalry existed between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
these two matrons which even extended to hats, feathers,
gowns and all the furbelows so dear to the feminine heart.
In fact, the far-famed houses of Montague and Capulet
could not have maintained more skillful tactics; and all
the while the Gothamites looked on and smiled. A few
years later Eugene Shiff, who had spent the greater portion
of his life in France, built a large house on Fifth
Avenue which he surmounted with a mansard roof. These
pioneers having set the pace, imposing residences were
erected in rapid succession, and the process has been continued
until the present day.</p>

<p>In December, 1851, New York was agog over the arrival
upon the shores of America of Louis Kossuth. As
everyone knows, he was the leader of the Hungarian
revolution of 1848-9, and became the first governor of the
short-lived Hungarian Republic. When this was overthrown
by Austria and other countries, Kossuth fled to
Turkey and subsequently sailed for this country on the
U.S. Frigate <i>Mississippi</i>. When his arrival became
known, thousands of people thronged the streets anxious
to catch a first glimpse of the distinguished foreigner.
One might have fancied from the enthusiasm displayed
that he was one of our own conquering heroes returning
home. Americans were even more sympathetic then than
now with all struggles for political freedom, as the history
of our own trying experiences during the Revolution
was, from a sentimental point of view, even more of a
controlling influence than it is to-day. Several months
later I heard Kossuth deliver an address at the National
Hotel in Washington before a large assembly chiefly composed
of members of Congress, when his subject was "Hungary
and her woes." I vividly recall the impression produced
upon his audience when, in his deeply melodious
tones, he invoked the "Throne of Grace" and closed with
the appealing words: "What is life without prayer?" I
have never before or since observed an audience so com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>pletely
under the sway of an orator, as it seemed to me
that there was not a person in the room who at the moment
would not have been willing to acquiesce in whatever
demands or appeals he might present. Kossuth's
countenance suggested such profound depression that one
could readily credit the assertion he made during his remarks,
"I have been trained to grief." He wore during
the delivery of his address the picturesque costume of the
Magyars of his country.</p>

<p>New York had an unusually large coterie of <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i>,
many of whom it was my good fortune to know. Some
of these had only recently returned from Brook Farm
"sadder but wiser" and, at all events, with more practical
views concerning "the world's broad field of battle."
Brook Farm had its origin in 1841, and completely collapsed
in 1847. It was chiefly intended to be the fulfillment
of a dream of the Rev. Dr. William Henry Channing
of "an association in which the members, instead of
preying upon one another and seeking to put one another
down, after the fashion of this world, should live together
as brothers, seeking one another's elevation and spiritual
growth." It was essentially socialistic in its conception
and execution and, although professedly altruistic in its
nature, was in reality a visionary scheme which reflected
but little credit upon the judgment of either its originators
or its patrons. Its company was composed of "members"
and "scholars," to whom may be added a celebrated
list of those who sojourned at the Farm for brief periods
and were known as "visitors." The whole scheme was
without doubt one of the most visionary expressions of
New England transcendentalism, and it failed because in
the nature of things no such ventures ever have succeeded
and, until human nature is essentially revolutionized,
probably never can. Among its most distinguished members
were Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charles A. Dana, later
the brilliant and accomplished editor of <i>The New York</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
<i>Sun</i>, and George Ripley. George William Curtis was one
of its scholars, and among its visitors were the Rev. William
Henry Channing, Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo
Emerson, Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Augustus Bronson,
Theodore Parker and Elizabeth P. Peabody&mdash;forming
together one of the most brilliant intellectual galaxies
that were ever associated in a single enterprise.</p>

<p>Of this number I especially recall George William Curtis,
a genius of the first brilliancy and remarkable withal
for his versatile conversational powers. I was talking to
him on one occasion when someone inquired as to his
especial work in the co-operative fold of Brook Farm.
His laughing reply was, "Cleaning door knobs." George
Ripley was a distinguished scholar and a prominent journalist.
His wife, a daughter of Francis Dana, became
a convert to Catholicism and is said to have found much
to console her in that faith until her death from cancer
in 1861. Margaret Fuller, though not possessed of much
outward grace, was a prolific votary of the pen. I occasionally
met her in society before she started on an European
tour where she met her destiny in the person of
the Marquis Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, to whom she was
secretly married in 1847. Some years later she embarked
with her husband and little boy upon a sailing vessel for
America, and all were lost off the coast of New York in
July, 1850. Horace Sumner, a younger brother of the
distinguished Massachusetts statesman, also perished at
the same time.</p>

<p>About 1845 I met Anne C. Lynch of Providence, who
came to New York to promote her literary ambitions, and
was a pleasing addition to this same intellectual circle. She
was the author of several prose works and also of some
poetical effusions which were published in 1848 and received
high commendation. She married Vincenzo Botta,
a learned Italian who at one time was a professor in the
University of Turin. Their tastes were similar and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
marriage was a very happy one. They lived for many
years on Thirty-seventh Street in New York, where they
maintained a charming <i>salon</i>. On Sunday evenings their
home was the rendezvous of many of the literary lights
of the metropolis as well as of distinguished strangers.
Some years before her marriage, Mrs. Botta was visiting
in Washington, where she formed a friendship with Henry
Clay. Upon her return to New York he committed to her
care a valuable gold medal, but upon arriving at her home
she discovered to her dismay that it was missing from her
trunk. It was the general impression that it had been
stolen from her on her way to New York. About the
same time I also knew Donald G. Mitchell ("Ik Marvel"),
but this was before he had entered upon his active
and distinguished literary career, and when he was a
temporary sojourner in New York. He was contributing
at that time some much appreciated letters to various magazines
under the signature of "The Lorgnette," which
were subsequently republished as a volume bearing the
same title.</p>

<p>N. P. Willis was another literary genius of the same
period whom I had the pleasure of knowing. He was
cordially welcomed into the social world of New York;
but, unfortunately for his popularity, he wrote a prose effusion
entitled, "Those Ungrateful Blidgimses," which
was generally recognized as a direct attack upon two old
ladies who were held in high esteem in New York. It
was known to many persons that he had had a misunderstanding
with them and that he had employed this manner
of taking his revenge. New York society frowned
upon what was generally considered his ungallant conduct,
and for many years the doors of some of the most prominent
houses in the city were closed against him. As I
remember reading his story at the time, I thought its title
was but a poor disguise, as the sisters were named Bridgens,
the christian name of one of them being Cornelia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
This name was distorted into "Crinny," who, by the way,
was a woman of decided ability. It was against her that
the author's animosity was chiefly directed. It seems
that the Misses Bridgens and Mr. Willis chanced to be sojourning
at the same time in Rome, where the scene of
his narrative is laid. Miss Crinny was a sufferer from
an attack of Roman fever and, under these dire circumstances,
Mr. Willis represents himself as her attendant,
and in this capacity refuses to condone the peculiarities
of the poor old lady's sick-room. His patience in gratifying
her morbid fancies is graphically described in a vein
of ridicule and he tells how by the hour he threaded what
he terms her "imaginary locks." He also dwells at
length upon her conversational powers and likens her
tongue to the elasticity of an eel's tail, which would wag
if it were skinned and fried. Charles Dudley Warner
has described this writing of Mr. Willis as "funny but
wicked"; it was more than that&mdash;it was cruel! Willis
made another reference to the two sisters in his "Earnest
Clay" where he speaks of "two abominable old maids by
the names of Buggins and Blidgins, representing the <i>scan.
mag.</i> of Florence."</p>

<p>The New York public was in no hurry to reopen its
doors to Mr. Willis; indeed, it was not until after his
marriage to Miss Cornelia Grinnell, his second wife, that
he was again kindly received. I recall with much pleasure
a visit I made at Mrs. Winfield Scott's in New York,
after that city had ceased to be my home, when we went
together to dine with Mr. and Mrs. N. P. Willis at Idlewild,
their country home on the Hudson. These were the
days when Mrs. Scott was sometimes facetiously called
<i>Madame la G&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>. This charming residence of Mr.
Willis was several miles south of Newburgh, on high
ground overlooking the river, and from its porches there
was an enchanting view of West Point. Mr. Willis told
us that when he first came to that vicinity he called the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
attention of a countryman from whom he had purchased
the land to some uncultivated acres and asked a suggestion
regarding them. "That," said the man, waving his hand
in the direction of the trees, "is nothing but an Idlewild."
The word lingered in Mr. Willis's mind, and he
subsequently adopted it as the name of his new home.</p>

<p>While living in New York we frequently attended
parties at the hospitable home of Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin
F. Butler in Washington Place. He was an elegant gentleman
of the old school and had served as Attorney General
in the cabinets of Presidents Jackson and Van Buren.
They were people of deep religious convictions, and consequently
all their entertainments were conducted upon
the strictest code of the day. For example, dancing was
never permitted and wine was never served. In place of
dancing there was a continuous promenade. I generally
attended these parties accompanied by my father, who
enjoyed meeting the legal lights of the country, some of
whom were always there. Exceptionally handsome suppers
were served at these entertainments, and every effort
was made by Mr. and Mrs. Butler to make up, as it were,
for the lack of dancing which was sorely missed by those
more gayly inclined.</p>

<p>A hundred thousand dollars was considered a highly
respectable fortune in New York between sixty and seventy
years ago. Seven per cent, was the usual rate of
interest, the cost of living was low, and life was, of
course, much simpler in every way. I recall a prominent
young man about this period, Henry Carroll Marx, commonly
called "Dandy Marx," who was said to be the
happy possessor of the amount I have named. He was
devoted to horses and from his home on Broadway he
could frequently be seen driving tandem on the cobblestone
streets. I do not remember his entering the social
arena; possibly he avoided it in order to escape the wiles
of designing mothers, whom one occasionally encountered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
even in those ancient days. His faultless attire, which in
elegance surpassed all his rivals, won for him the nickname
of "Dandy." He also rendered himself conspicuous
as the first gentleman in New York to wear the long,
straight, and pointed waxed mustache. His two maiden
sisters were inseparable companions and nearly every day
could be seen walking on Broadway. Miss Lydia Kane,
one of the wits of my day and of whom I have already
spoken, facetiously called them "number 11"&mdash;two
straight marks!</p>

<p>In 1845 Burton's Theater was an unfailing source of
delight to the pleasure-loving public. William E. Burton
was an Englishman of rare cultivation, and was the greatest
comedian New York had ever known. Although so
gifted, his expression of countenance was one of extreme
gravity. His presentation of Aminadab Sleek in the
"Serious Family" has, in my opinion, never been surpassed.
He frequently acted in minor comedies, but the
"Serious Family" was his greatest <i>r&ocirc;le</i>. Niblo's Garden
on Broadway, near Houston Street, was a source of great
delight in those days to all Gothamites. It was in this
theater that the Ravel family had its remarkable athletic
performances. When I recall their graceful, youthful
physiques, I am reminded of Hamlet's philosophical musings
in the graveyard: "Where be your gibes now, your
gambols, your songs, your flashes of merriment that
were wont to set the table on a roar?" P. T. Barnum
was a conspicuous figure about this time. His museum
was on Broadway, at the corner of Ann Street, and not
far from the City Hall. He was considered a prince of
humbugs and perhaps gloried in his reputation as such.
I distinctly remember the excitement which he created
over a mummified old colored woman who, he asserted,
had been a nurse of Washington, and to whom he gave
the name of Joice Heth. She was undoubtedly a very
aged negress, but she still retained full powers of articu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>lation
and was well coached to reply in an intelligent manner
to the numerous inquiries respecting her pretended
charge. It is needless to add that she was only one of
Barnum's numerous fakes.</p>

<p>Philip Kearny, a handsome gentleman of a former
school, who lived at the corner of Broadway and Leonard
Street, was a lavish entertainer. He was a widower when
I knew him, but his daughter, the wife of Major Alexander
S. Macomb, U.S.A., the son and aide of Major General
Alexander Macomb, Commander-in-Chief of the Army,
lived with him. Major Macomb was conspicuous for his
attractive personality and imposing presence and was said
to bear a striking resemblance to Prince Albert, the father
of Edward VII. His wife was one of the three heirs of
John Watts, who owned a princely estate. The other two
were her brother, the gallant General Philip Kearny,
and her cousin, General John Watts de Peyster, a son of
that most accomplished gentleman, Frederick de Peyster,
of whom I have already spoken. Mrs. Macomb was a generous
and attractive woman who dispensed with a liberal
hand the wealth she had inherited. Her pretty cousins,
Mary and Nancy Kearny, whom I knew quite well,
daughters of her father's brothers, were her constant
guests. Another frequent visitor of this household was
Mrs. "Phil" Kearny, as she was invariably called, whose
maiden name was Diana Moore Bullitt, a famous Kentucky
belle, well-known for her grace and intellectual attractions.
Her sister Eloise, usually called "Lou" Bullitt
by her intimate friends, married Baron Frederick de
Kantzow of Sweden, a courtly foreigner who had commercial
relations with the merchant princes of New York.
Tradition states that the Baroness de Kantzow, though
not possessed of Mrs. Kearny's beauty, was a more successful
slayer of hearts than her sister, and it is said that
she had adorers by the score. A third Bullitt sister,
Mary, married General Henry Atkinson and after his death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Major Adam Duncan Steuart, both of the United States
Army, the latter of whom was stationed for many years at
Fort Leavenworth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Macomb's health failed at an early period of life
and to restore it she sought a foreign clime; but, alas, her
many friends were never gladdened again by her kindly
welcome, as she died abroad. In my young womanhood
I frequently attended parties at the Kearny house where
dancing and other social pleasures enlivened the scene.
In this connection it seems proper to refer at greater
length to John Watts and his interesting trio of daughters.
I have already spoken of his son Robert, who died
unmarried at an early age. His two older daughters,
Susanna, wife of Philip Kearny, and Mary Justina, wife
of Frederick de Peyster, did not long survive their marriages;
but a third daughter, Elizabeth, the wife of Henry
Laight, who never had children, lived many years with
her father and managed the affairs of his household.
An amusing story was told me many years ago regarding
Mrs. Laight which is well worthy of mention. As a
young girl she was deeply in love with the young man who
eventually became her husband, but her father was so
devoted to her and so very dependent upon her that he
violently opposed her marrying anyone. Accordingly, a
secret marriage was planned by the young people to take
place in Trinity Church. As the youthful pair was standing
in front of the altar, surrounded by a few sympathetic
friends, the rector reached the words, "Who giveth this
woman to be married to this man?" when, to the astonishment
of the assembled group, a gruff, loud voice in the
rear of the church shouted "I do." Old John Watts
had opposed his daughter's marriage with all his might,
but when he learned by chance that she was to be married
clandestinely, he graciously accepted the inevitable and
without the knowledge of anyone hurried to the church
and, entering it by a side door, duly performed his part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
as just related. This anecdote was told me by Arent
Schuyler de Peyster, a distant cousin of General John
Watts de Peyster. Many years later, when I repeated it
to Mrs. Diana Bullitt Kearny, she remarked in her characteristic
manner: "He was mean enough not to even allow
her the satisfaction of a runaway marriage." This
estimate of his character, however, does not seem to agree
with that given by others. The Laights were prominent
in New York society. One of them, Edward Laight, whom
I knew as a society beau, was remarkably handsome. He
was a good deal of a flirt and transferred his affections
with remarkable facility from one young woman to another.
His sister married a Greek, Mr. Eugene Dutilh,
a gentleman of culture and refinement, who owned a
beautiful place at Garrison's-on-the-Hudson which he sold
about 1861 to Hamilton Fish.</p>

<p>Philip Kearny and his family lived next door to Peter
A. Jay, and I frequently met the young people of his
household at Mrs. Macomb's parties. Gouverneur Morris,
a son of the distinguished statesman, and Edward Kearny
were <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of this establishment, as were also Ridley
and Essex Watts, both of whom I knew well. General
"Phil" Kearny from his youthful days was an enthusiastic
soldier, but he was not a graduate of West Point, having
been appointed to the regular army from civil life
by President Van Buren in 1837. He served throughout
the Mexican War, where he had the misfortune to
lose an arm at the battle of Churubusco, and was killed
during the Civil War in 1862 at the battle of Chantilly.</p>

<p>Speaking of General Macomb, I am reminded of a social
<i>on dit</i> of many years ago. Mrs. August Belmont (Caroline
Slidell Perry) lived in a fine house on Fifth Avenue
and frequently gave large receptions. His sister, Sarah
Perry, subsequently Mrs. R. S. Rodgers, was an early friend
of mine. The elegant Major Alexander S. Macomb, who was
his father's namesake and aide, on entering Mrs. Belmont's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
drawing-room was unfortunate enough to brush against
a handsome vase and completely shatter it. It was generally
conceded that his hostess was conscious of the disaster,
but "was mistress of herself though China fall" and
appeared entirely unconscious of the mishap. Some
months later at the house of Lady Cunard (Mary McEvers),
a similar accident happened. The unfortunate guest, however,
in this case was immediately approached by his hostess,
who with much elegant grace begged him not to be
disturbed as the damage was trifling. Immediately society
began an animated discussion, when even the judicial
powers of Solomon might have found it embarrassing to
decide which of the two women should be accorded the
greater degree of <i>savoir faire</i>.</p>

<p>In 1844, accompanied by my father, I attended the wedding
of Estelle Livingston, daughter of John Swift Livingston,
to John Watts de Peyster. At the time of this
marriage, Mr. de Peyster was considered the finest <i>parti</i>
in the city; while, apart from his great wealth, he was so
unusually talented that it was generally believed a brilliant
future awaited him. It was a home wedding, and
the drawing-room was well filled with the large family
connection and other invited guests. At this time Mr.
Livingston was a widower, but his sister Maria, Mrs. John
C. Stevens of Hoboken, did the honors of the occasion for
her brother. The young bride presented a charming appearance
in all her finery, and at the bountiful collation
following the ceremony champagne flowed freely. This,
however, was no unusual thing, as that beverage was generally
seen at every entertainment in those good old days.
Mrs. John C. Stevens lived at one time in Barclay Street,
and I have heard numerous stories concerning her eccentricities.
In 1849 she gave a fancy-dress ball but, as she
had failed to revise her visiting list in many years, persons
who had long been dead were among her invited guests.
She was especially peculiar in her mode of dress, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was not always adapted to her social position. It is therefore
not at all surprising that unfortunate mistakes were
occasionally made in regard to her identity. Another of
her eccentricities consisted in the fact that she positively
refused, when shopping, to recognize even her most intimate
friends, as she said it was simply impossible for her
to combine business with pleasure. In spite of her peculiarities,
however, she possessed unusual social charm.
Her husband was prominent in society and business circles.
He was founder of the New York Yacht Club as
well as its first president, and commanded the <i>America</i> in
the memorable race in England in 1851, which won the
celebrated cup that Sir Thomas Lipton and other English
yachtsmen have failed to restore to their native land.
Mary Livingston, the younger daughter of John Swift
Livingston, was a <i>petite</i> beauty. She married a distant
relative, a son of Maturin Livingston. I am told that her
brother, Johnston Livingston, is still living in New York
at a very advanced age.</p>

<p>Joseph Kemmerer's band was an indispensable adjunct
to all social gatherings in the days of which I am speaking.
The number of instruments used was always in proportion
to the size of the entertainment. The inspiring
airs of Strauss and Labitzky, then in vogue, were popular
with the younger set. These airs bring back pleasant
memories, as I have frequently danced to them. The
waltz in my day was a fine art and its votaries were numerous.
I recall the fact that Edward James of Albany,
a witty young gentleman with whom I occasionally danced,
was such a devotee to the waltz that, not possessing sufficient
will power to resist its charms and having a delicate
constitution, he nearly danced himself into another
world. Two attractive young brothers, Thomas H. and
Daniel Messinger, who were general beaux in society,
played their parts most successfully in the social world
by their graceful dancing, and no ball was considered com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>plete
without their presence. These brothers were associated
in the umbrella industry, and Miss Lydia Kane, some
of whose witty remarks I have already quoted, dubbed
them the "reigning beaux!" Daniel Messinger eventually
married Miss Elizabeth Coles Neilson, a daughter of Anthony
Bleecker Neilson, and became a Lieutenant Colonel
in the Union Army during the Civil War.</p>

<p>The British Consul General in New York from 1817 to
1843 was James Buchanan. He was Irish by birth, and
many young British subjects visiting the United States
made his home their headquarters. He had several
daughters and, as the whole family was social in its tastes,
I often enjoyed meeting these sturdy representatives of
John Bull at his house. Those I knew best came from
"the land of brown heath and shaggy wood," as in
our family we were naturally partial to Scotchmen and,
as a rule, regarded them as desirable acquaintances.
Many of these were graduates of Glasgow University
and young men of unusual culture and refinement. I
especially remember Mr. McCorquodale, a nephew of Dr.
Thomas Chalmers, the distinguished Presbyterian Divine
of Scotland. He met his future wife in New York in the
person of a wealthy and attractive widow. Her maiden
name I do not recall, although I am acquainted with certain
facts concerning her lineage. She was the granddaughter
of Madame de Genlis.</p>

<p>I doubt whether any of these young Scotchmen whom
I met remained permanently in this country, as they always
seemed too loyal to the "Land o' Cakes" to entirely
expatriate themselves. Another young Scotchman, Mr.
Dundas, whom I knew quite well through the Buchanans,
embarked for his native land on board the steamer <i>President</i>.
This ship sailed in the spring of 1841 and never
reached her destination. What became of her was never
known and her fate remains to this day one of the mysteries
of the sea. In the fall of 1860 the U.S. man-of-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>war
<i>Levant</i>, on her voyage from the Hawaiian Islands
to Panama, disappeared in the same mysterious manner
in the Pacific Ocean; and, as was the case with the <i>President</i>,
no human being aboard of her was ever heard of
again. There were many conjectures in regard to the
fate of this ship, but the true story of her doom has never
been revealed. I remember two of the officers who perished
with her. One of them was Lieutenant Edward C.
Stout, who had married a daughter of Commodore John
H. Aulick, U.S.N., and whose daughters, the Misses
Julia and Minnie Stout, are well remembered in Washington
social circles; and the other was Purser Andrew J.
Watson, who was a member of one of the old residential
families of the District of Columbia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>WASHINGTON IN THE FORTIES</h3>


<p>My first visit to Washington was in 1845. I
started from New York at eight o'clock in the
morning and reached Philadelphia late the same
afternoon. I broke the journey by spending the night at
Jones's Hotel in the lower part of the city, which was the
usual stopping place of travelers who made this trip. A
few years later when the journey from New York to Washington
was made in twelve hours, it was thought that almost
a miracle had been performed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winfield Scott in 1855 characterized the National
Capital as "an ill-contrived, ill-arranged, rambling,
scrambling village"; and it was certainly all of that when
I first saw it. It is not improbable that the cause of this
condition of affairs was a general feeling of uncertainty
as to whether Washington would remain the permanent
seat of government, especially as the West was naturally
clamoring for a more centrally located capital. When I
first visited the city the ubiquitous real-estate agent had
not yet materialized, and corner lots, now so much in demand,
could be purchased at a small price. Taxation
was moderate and Congress, then as now, held itself responsible
for one-half of the taxes. As land was cheap
there was no necessity for economy in its use, and spacious
fronts were built regardless of back-buildings. In other
cases, when one's funds were limited, the rear of the
house was first built and later a more imposing front was
added. The contrast between the houses of New York,
built closely together in blocks, and those in Washington,
with the abundant space around them, was a great sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>prise
to me. Unlike many other cities, land in Washington,
then, as now, was sold and taxed by the square foot.</p>

<p>My elder sister Fanny had married Charles Eames,
Esq., of the Washington Bar, and my visit was to her.
Mr. Eames entered Harvard in 1827 when less than sixteen
years of age, and was a classmate of Wendell Phillips
and of John Lothrop Motley, the historian. The distinguished
Professor of Harvard University, Andrew P. Peabody,
LL.D., in referring to him many years after his
death said that he was "the first scholar of his class, and
was regarded as a man of unlimited power of acquisition,
and of marked ability as a public speaker." After leaving
Harvard he studied law, but ill health prevented him
from practicing his profession. He accompanied to Washington
George Bancroft, President Polk's Secretary of the
Navy, by whom he was made principal correspondence
clerk of the Navy Department. He remained there but a
few months when he became associate editor of <i>The Washington
Union</i> under the well-known Thomas Ritchie, usually
known as "Father Ritchie." He was subsequently
appointed by Polk a commissioner to negotiate a treaty
with the Hawaiian Islands, and took passage upon the
U.S. Frigate <i>Savannah</i> and sailed, by way of Cape Horn,
for San Francisco. He unexpectedly found awaiting his
arrival in that city Dr. Gerrit P. Judd, Prime Minister of
the King, with two young Hawaiian princes. After the
treaty was made, he returned east and for six months
edited <i>The Nashville Union</i>, when he again assumed charge
of <i>The Washington Union</i>. President Pierce subsequently
appointed him Minister to Venezuela, where he remained
until 1859, and then returned to Washington, where he
practiced his profession for the remainder of his life. It
was while arguing an important case before the Supreme
Court that he was stricken, and he died on the 16th of
March, 1867. He sustained a high reputation as an admiralty
lawyer as well as for his knowledge of inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>national
jurisprudence. I have now before me a letter
addressed to his widow by Wendell Phillips only three
days after his death. It is one of the valued possessions
of Mr. Eames's daughter, who is my niece and the wife
of that genial Scotchman, Alexander Penrose Gordon-Cumming.
It reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Quincy</span>, Illinois, March 19, 1867.</p>

<p>My dear friend,</p>

<p>I have just crossed from the other side of the Mississippi,
and am saddened by learning from the papers my
old and dear friend's death.</p>

<p>The associations that bind us together go back many,
many years. We were boys together in sunny months
full of frolic, plans and hopes. The merriment and the
seriousness, the toil and the ambition of those days all
cluster round him as memory brings him to me in the flush
of his youth. I have seen little of him of late years, as
you know, but the roots of our friendship needed no constant
care; they were too strong to die or wilt, and when
we did meet it was always with the old warmth and intimacy.
I feel more alone in the world now he has gone.
One by one the boy's comrades pass over the river and
life loses with each some of its interest.</p>

<p>I was hoping in coming years, as life grew less busy, to
see more of my old playmate, and this is a very unexpected
blow. Be sure I sympathize with you most tenderly,
and could not resist the impulse to tell you so.
Little as we have met, I owe to your kind and frank interest
in me a sense of very warm and close relation to
you&mdash;feel as if I had known you ever so many years. I
hope our paths may lead us more together so that I may
learn to know you better and gather some more distinct
ideas of Eames' later years. All his youth I have by heart.</p>

<p>With most affectionate regards believe me</p>

<p class='indent3'>Very faithfully yours,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">Wendell Phillips</span>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eames.</p>

<p>I think women never fully realize the strange tenderness
with which men cling to college mates. No mat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>ter
how much opinions or residence separate grown-up
men, to have been classmates is a tie that like blood never
loosens. Any man that has a heart feels it thrill at the
sight of one of <i>those</i> comrades. Later friendships may be
close, never so tender&mdash;this makes boys of us again at any
moment. Unfamiliar tears obey its touch, and a singular
sense of loneliness settles down on survivors&mdash;Good-bye.</p></div>

<p>The young Hawaiian princes to whom I have just referred
and who, by the way, were mere boys, accompanied
Dr. Judd to New York where my younger brother, Malcolm,
thinking he might make the acquaintance of some
genial playmates, called to see them. Upon his return
from his visit his only criticism was, "those dusky princes
certainly give themselves airs."</p>

<p>My sister, Mrs. Eames, lived in a house on G
Street near Twenty-first Street in what was then known
as the First Ward. This general section, together with
a part of Indiana Avenue, some portions of Capitol Hill,
Sixth and Seventh Streets, and all of that part of the
city bounded on the north by K Street, on the south by
Pennsylvania Avenue, and westward of Fourteenth
Street to Georgetown, was at this time the fashionable
section of the city. Like many other places in its formative
period, Washington then presented the picture of
fine dwelling houses and shanties standing side by side.
I remember, for example, that as late as 1870 a fine residence
on the corner of I and Fifteenth Streets was located
next to a small frame house occupied by a colored
undertaker. The latter's business was prosperous, but his
wealthy neighbor objected to the constant reminder of
death caused by seeing from his fine bay window the
numerous coffins carried in and out. He asked the undertaker
to name his price for his property, but he declined,
and all of his subsequent offers were ignored. Finally,
after several years' patient waiting, during which offer
after offer had been politely but positively rejected, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
last one being an almost princely sum, the owner sold his
home and moved away, leaving his humble neighbor in triumphant
possession. This is simply a fair example of the
conditions existing in Washington when I first knew it.</p>

<p>Two rows of houses on Pennsylvania Avenue, known as
the "Six and Seven Buildings," were fashionable dwellings.
Admiral David D. Porter, then a Lieutenant in the
Navy, occupied one of them. Miss Catharine L. Brooke
kept a girls' school in another, while still another was the
residence of William Lee of Massachusetts. I have been
informed that while serving in a consular office abroad,
under the appointment of President Monroe, Mr. Lee was
commissioned by him to select a dinner set for the White
House.</p>

<p>Architects, if I remember correctly, were almost unknown
in Washington at this time. When a person was
sufficiently venturesome to build a house for himself, he
selected a residence suited to his tastes and directed a
builder to erect one like it. Speculative building was entirely
unknown, and if any resident of the District had
embarked upon such a venture he would have been regarded
as the victim of a vivid but disordered fancy.</p>

<p>Mrs. C. R. Latimer kept a fashionable boarding house in
a large brick dwelling facing Lafayette Square where the
Belasco Theater now stands. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton
Fish boarded with her while the former was a Representative
in Congress, and Mr. and Mrs. Sanders Irving,
so well and favorably known to all old Washingtonians,
also made this house their home. Many years
later it was the residence of William H. Seward, and he
was living there when the memorable attempt was made
in 1865 to assassinate him. As is well known, it subsequently
became the home of James G. Blaine. When Hamilton
Fish was elected to the Senate, he purchased a house
on H Street, between Seventeenth and Eighteenth Streets,
which was afterwards known as the "Porter house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Previously it had been owned and occupied by General
"Phil" Kearny.</p>

<p>The shops of Washington in 1845 were not numerous,
and were located chiefly upon Pennsylvania Avenue, Seventh
Street then being a residential section. The most
prominent dry-goods store was kept by Darius Clagett
at the corner of Ninth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue.
Mr. Clagett, invariably cordial and courteous, always
stood behind his counter, and I have had many pleasant
chats with him while making my purchases. Although he
kept an excellent selection of goods, it was usually the
custom for prominent Washington folk to make their
larger purchases in Baltimore. A little later Walter Harper
kept a dry-goods store on Pennsylvania Avenue, near
Eighth Street, and some years later two others appeared,
one kept by William M. Shuster on Pennsylvania Avenue,
first between Seventh and Eighth Streets, and later between
Ninth and Tenth; and the other by Augustus and
Thomas Perry on the corner of Ninth Street and Pennsylvania
Avenue. Charles Demonet, the confectioner,
made his appearance a little later on Pennsylvania Avenue,
between Seventeenth and Eighteenth Streets; but
Charles Gautier, on Pennsylvania Avenue, between
Twelfth and Thirteenth Streets, was his successful rival
and was regarded more favorably in aristocratic circles.
Madame Marguerite M. Delarue kept a shop on the north
side of the same avenue, also between Twelfth and Thirteenth
Streets, where small articles of dress dear to the
feminine heart could be bought. There were several
large grocery stores on the south side of Pennsylvania
Avenue, between Sixth and Seventh Streets. Benjamin
L. Jackson and Brother were the proprietors of one and
James L. Barbour and John A. Hamilton of another, although
the two latter had their business house at an earlier
day on Louisiana Avenue. Louis Vavans was the accomplished
cook and caterer, and sent to their rooms the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
meals of many persons temporarily residing in Washington.
Joseph Redfern, his son-in-law, kept a grocery store
in the First Ward. Franck Taylor, the father of the late
Rear Admiral Henry C. Taylor, U.S.N., was the proprietor
of a book store on Pennsylvania Avenue, near Four-and-a-Half
Street, where many of the scholarly men of
the day congregated to discuss literary and current topics.
His store had a bust of Sir Walter Scott over its door,
and he usually kept his front show-windows closed to prevent
the light from fading the bindings of his books.
The Center Market was located upon the same site as at
present, but of course it has since been greatly enlarged
and improved. All the stores on Louisiana Avenue sold
at retail. I remember the grocery store of J. Harrison
Semmes on Ninth Street and Louisiana Avenue, opposite
the Center Market; and the hardware store kept by
Joseph Savage on Pennsylvania Avenue, between Sixth
and Seventh Streets, and at another time between Third
and Fourth Streets.</p>

<p>On Fifteenth Street opposite the Treasury was another
well-known boarding house, conducted by Mrs. Ulrich and
much patronized by members of the Diplomatic Corps.
Willard's Hotel was just around the corner on the site
of the New Willard, and its proprietor was Caleb Willard.
Brown's Hotel, farther down town, on Pennsylvania
Avenue and Sixth Street, was a popular rendezvous
for Congressional people. It was first called the Indian
Queen, and was kept by that prince of hosts, Jesse Brown.
After his death the name was changed to the Metropolitan.</p>

<p>The National Hotel on the opposite corner was the largest
hostelry in Washington. It boasted of a large Southern
<i>cli&eacute;nt&egrave;le</i>, and until President Buchanan's administration
enjoyed a very prosperous career. Subsequent to
Buchanan's inauguration, however, a mysterious epidemic
appeared among the guests of the house which the physicians
of the District failed to satisfactorily diagnose. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
became commonly known as the "National Hotel disease,"
and resulted in numerous deaths. A notice occasionally
appeared in the current newspapers stating that the deceased
had died from this malady. Mrs. Robert Greenhow,
in her book published in London during the Civil
War, entitled "My Imprisonment and the First Years of
Abolition Rule at Washington," attributes the epidemic
to the machinations of the Republicans, who were desirous
of disposing of President Buchanan. John Gadsby was
its proprietor at one time, from whom it usually went by
the name of "Gadsby's." President Buchanan was one of
its guests on the eve of his inauguration.</p>

<p>When I first knew Washington, slavery was in full sway
and, with but few exceptions, all servants were colored.
The wages of a good cook were only six or seven dollars a
month, but their proficiency in the culinary art was remarkable.
I remember once hearing Count Adam
Gurowski, who had traversed the European continent,
remark that he had never anywhere tasted such cooking
as in the South. The grace of manner of many of the
elderly male slaves of that day would, indeed, have
adorned a court. When William L. Marcy, who, although
a master in statesmanship and diplomacy, was not especially
gifted in external graces, was taking final leave of
the clerks in the War Department, where as Secretary he
had rendered such distinguished services under President
Polk, he shook hands with an elderly colored employee
named Datcher, who had formerly been a body servant to
President Monroe, and said: "Good-bye, Datcher; if I had
had your manners I should have left more friends behind
me." Some years later, and after my marriage into the
Gouverneur family, I had the good fortune to have passed
down to me a venerable colored man who had served my
husband's family for many years and whose name was
"Uncle James." His manner at times was quite overpowering.
On entering my drawing-room on one occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to greet George Newell, brother-in-law and guest of ex-Governor
Marcy, I found him seated upon a sofa and apparently
engaged in a "brown study." Referring at once
to "Uncle James," he inquired: "Who is that man?"
Upon my replying, "An old family servant," he remarked:
"Well, he is the most polite man I have ever
met."</p>

<p>Some years later my sister, Mrs. Eames, moved into a
house on the corner of H and Fourteenth Streets, which
she and her husband had built and which she occupied
until her death in 1890. I naturally shrink from dwelling
in detail upon her charm of manner and social career,
and prefer rather to quote an extract from a sketch which
appeared in one of the newspapers just after her death:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... During the twenty-eight years of her married
life in Washington Mrs. Eames's house was one of the favorite
resorts of the most conspicuous and interesting men
of the nation; it was a species of neutral ground where
men of all parties and shades of political opinion found
it agreeable to foregather. Though at first in moderate
circumstances and living in a house which rented for less
than $300 a year, there was no house in Washington except,
perhaps, the President's, where one was sure of meeting
any evening throughout the year so many people of
distinction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;"><a name="img5" id="img5"></a>
<a href="images/img05.jpg"><img src="images/img05th.jpg" width="326" height="400" alt="Mrs. Charles Eames, ne&eacute; Campbell, by Gambadella.
Owned by Mrs. Gordon-Cumming." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Mrs. Charles Eames, ne&eacute; Campbell, by Gambadella.<br /></span>
<span class='caption2'><i>Owned by Mrs. Gordon-Cumming.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Marcy were devoted to Mrs. Eames; her
<i>salon</i> was almost the daily resort of Edward Everett,
Rufus Choate, Charles Sumner, Secretary [James] Guthrie,
Governor [John A.] Andrews of Massachusetts, Winter
Davis, Caleb Cushing, Senator Preston King, N.P.
Banks, and representative men of that ilk. Mr. [Samuel
J.] Tilden when in Washington was often their guest. The
gentlemen, who were all on the most familiar terms with the
family, were in the habit of bringing their less conspicuous
friends from time to time, thus making it quite the
most attractive <i>salon</i> that has been seen in Washington
since the death of Mrs. Madison, and made such without
any of the attractions of wealth or luxury.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The relations thus established with the public men of
the country at her fireside were strengthened and enriched
by a voluminous correspondence. Her father, who was a
very accomplished man, had one of the largest and choicest
private libraries in New York, of which, from the time she
could read, Mrs. Eames had the freedom; in this library
she spent more time than anyone else, and more than anywhere
else, until her marriage. As a consequence, it is no
disparagement to any one else to say that during her residence
there she was intellectually quite the most accomplished
woman in Washington. Her epistolary talent was
famous in her generation.</p>

<p>Her correspondence if collected and published would
prove to have been not less voluminous than Mme. de
Sevign&eacute;'s and, in point of literary art, in no particular
inferior to that of the famous French woman.</p></div>

<p>After three or four months spent in Washington, I returned
to my home in New York; and several years later,
in the spring of 1848, suffered one of the severest ordeals
of my life. I refer to my father's death. No human
being ever entered eternity more beloved or esteemed than
he, and as I look back to my life with him I realize that
I was possibly more blessed than I deserved to be permitted
to live with such a well-nigh perfect character and
to know him familiarly. From my earliest childhood I
was accustomed to see the sorrowing and oppressed come
to him for advice. He was especially qualified to perform
such a function owing to his long tenure of the office
of Surrogate. Widows and orphans who could not
afford litigation always found in him a faithful friend.
With a capacity of feeling for the wrongs of others as
keenly as though inflicted upon himself, his sympathy invariably
assumed a practical form and he accordingly
left behind him hosts of sorrowing and grateful hearts.
A short time before his death I visited a dying widow, a
devoted Roman Catholic, whom from time to time my
father had assisted. When I was about to leave, she said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
"Say to your father I hope to meet him among the just
made perfect." This remark of a poor woman has been
to me through all these years a greater consolation than
any public tribute or imposing eulogy. Finely chiseled
monuments and fulsome epitaphs are not to be compared
with the benediction of grateful hearts.</p>

<p>The funeral services were conducted, according to the
custom of sixty years ago, by the Rev. Dr. William Adams
and the Rev. Dr. Philip Milledoler. Members of the bar
and many prominent residents of New York, including
his two physicians, Doctors John W. Francis and Campbell
F. Stewart, walked behind the coffin, which, by the
way, was not placed in a hearse but was carried to the
Second Street Cemetery, where his remains were temporarily
placed. There were six clergymen present at
his funeral&mdash;the Rev. Doctors Thomas De Witt, Thomas
E. Vermilye, Philip Milledoler, William Adams, John
Knox and George H. Fisher, all ministers of the Reformed
Dutch Church except the Rev. Dr. Adams, the distinguished
Presbyterian divine.</p>

<p>I find myself almost instinctively returning to the
Scott family as associated with the most cherished memories
of some of the happiest days of my life. During my
childhood I formed a close intimacy with Cornelia Scott,
the second daughter of the distinguished General, which
continued until the close of her life. When I first knew
the family it made its winter home in New York at
the American Hotel, then a fashionable hostelry kept by
William B. Cozzens, on the corner of Barclay Street and
Broadway. In the summer the family resided at Hampton,
the old Mayo place near Elizabeth in New Jersey,
where they kept open house. Colonel John Mayo of Richmond,
whose daughter Maria was the wife of General
Scott, had purchased this country seat many years before
as a favor to his wife, Miss Abigail De Hart of New Jersey,
and Mrs. Scott subsequently inherited it. Colonel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
John Mayo, who was a citizen of large wealth and great
prominence, was so public-spirited that not long subsequent
to the Revolutionary War, and entirely at his own
expense, he built from his own plans a bridge across the
James River at Richmond. I have heard Mrs. Scott
graphically describe her father's trips from Richmond to
Elizabeth in his coach-of-four with outriders and grooms,
and his enthusiastic reception when he reached his
destination.</p>

<p>I have frequently heard it said that Mrs. Scott as a
young woman refused the early offers of marriage from
the man who eventually became her husband because his
rank in the army was too low to suit her taste, but that
she finally relented when he became a General. I am
able to contradict this statement as Mrs. Scott told me
with her own lips that she never made his acquaintance
until he was a General, in spite of the fact that they were
both natives of the same State. This did not by any
means, however, indicate a marriage late in life, as General
Scott became a Brigadier General on the 9th of March,
1814, when he was between twenty-seven and twenty-eight
years of age. In the <i>Sentinel</i>, published in Newark,
New Jersey, on the 25th of March, 1817, the following
marriage notice appears:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Married&mdash;at Belleville, Virginia, at the seat of Col.
Mayo, General Winfield Scott of the U.S. Army to Miss
Maria D. Mayo.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Scott's record as a belle was truly remarkable, and
in the latter years of her life when I knew her very intimately
she still retained traces of great beauty. Her
accomplishments, too, were extraordinary for that period.
She was not only a skilled performer upon the piano and
harp, but also a linguist of considerable proficiency, while
her grace of manner and brilliant powers of repartee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
added greatly to her social charms. On one occasion during
Polk's administration she attended a levee at the
White House, and as she passed down the line with the
other guests she received an enthusiastic welcome and was
soon so completely surrounded by an admiring throng that
for a while Mrs. Polk was left very much to herself. It
was Mrs. Scott who wrote in the album of a friend the
verse entitled, "The Two Faults of Men." Two other
verses were written under it several years later by
the Hon. William C. Somerville of Maryland, at one time
our Minister to Sweden, and the author of "Letters from
Paris on the Causes and Consequences of the French
Revolution."</p>

<p>Many years ago General and Mrs. Scott traveled with
their youthful family through Europe, and while at the
French Capital Mrs. Scott attended a fancy-dress ball
where she represented Pocahontas and was called <i>La
belle sauvage</i>. I have talked to two elderly officers of
our Army, Colonel John M. Fessenden and General John
B. Magruder, the latter subsequently of Confederate fame,
and both of them told me that at this entertainment she
was an object of general admiration. Many years later,
long after Mrs. Scott's death, I was visiting her daughter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Mrs. Henry L. Scott, for the last time at the old Elizabeth
home, accompanied by my young daughter Maud, when
the latter was invited to a fancy-dress ball given to children
at the residence of General George Herbert Pegram.
At first I was at my wits' end to devise a suitable gown
for her to wear, when Mrs. Scott brought out the historic
fancy dress worn by her mother so many years before in
Paris and gave it to me. It seems almost needless to
add that the child wore the dress, and that I have it now
carefully put away among my treasured possessions.
Many years subsequent to Mrs. Scott's visit to Paris, her
sister, Mrs. Robert Henry Cabell of Richmond, published
for the benefit of a charity her letters written from abroad
to her family in Virginia, containing many interesting
recollections of Paris.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Mexican War the Scotts were
living in New York but, for a reason I do not now recall,
Mrs. Scott decided to spend a winter during the General's
absence in Philadelphia. She secured a portion of a furnished
house at 111 South Sixth Street, and in the spring
of 1847 I was invited to be her guest. The evening of
the day of my arrival I attended a party at the residence
of Judge John Meredith Read, a descendant of George
Read, a Signer from Delaware. Upon the urgent request
of Mrs. Scott I went to this entertainment entirely alone,
as she and her daughter Cornelia were indisposed and she
wished her household to be represented. Judge Read was
a widower and some years later I renewed my acquaintance
with him in Washington. During my visit in Philadelphia,
Mrs. Scott was suddenly called away and hesitated
about leaving us two young girls in the house alone, her
younger daughters being absent at school. Finally, she
made arrangements for us to spend the days of her absence
in Burlington, New Jersey, with Miss Susan Wallace,
a friend of hers and a niece of the Hon. William
Bradford, Attorney-General during a portion of Wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>ington's
last administration. This, however, was not altogether
a satisfactory arrangement for us young people
and we became decidedly restless, but to Burlington we
went just the same. Meanwhile, news came from Mexico
of a great American victory and the public went wild
with enthusiasm. Philadelphia made plans to celebrate
the glad event on a certain evening, and Cornelia Scott
and I decided to return to Philadelphia for the festivities.
We carefully planned the trip and took as our protector
a faithful colored man named Lee. Arabella Griffith, an
adopted daughter of Miss Wallace, also accompanied us,
and as another companion we took Mrs. Scott's pet dog
<i>Gee</i> whom, before the evening was over, we found to be
very troublesome. We made the trip to Philadelphia by
water and landed in an out-of-the-way portion of the city.
Owing to the dense crowds assembled to view the decorations,
illuminations and fireworks, we were unable to procure
a carriage and consequently were obliged to walk,
while, to cap the climax, in pushing through the crowd
we lost Miss Griffith. General Scott's name was upon the
lips of everyone, and his pictures were seen hanging
from many windows; yet the daughter of the hero who
was the cause of all the enthusiasm was a simple wayfarer,
rubbing elbows with the multitude, unrecognized
and entirely ignored. I may state, by the way, that Arabella
Griffith subsequently became the wife of General
Francis C. Barlow and that, while her husband was fighting
the battles of his country during the Civil War, she
did noble service in the Union hospitals as a member of
the United States Sanitary Commission, and died in the
summer of 1864 from a fever contracted in the hospitals
of the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>I remained in Philadelphia much longer than I had
originally anticipated, and unexpected warm weather
found me totally unprepared. I immediately wrote to my
sister Margaret and asked her to send me some suitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
apparel. Her letter in reply to mine, which I insert,
gives something of an idea of New York society of that
period. As she was quite a young girl her references to
Miss Julia Gerard whom she knew quite well and "Old
Leslie Irving," who, by the way, was only a young man,
must be regarded merely as the silly utterances of extreme
youth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dear Sister,</p>

<p>I received your letter and as it requires an immediate
answer, I shall commence writing you one. I believe in
my last I mentioned to you that I was going to Virginia
Wood's [Mrs. John L. Rogers] the following evening. I
went with [William B.] Clerke [a young broker] and had
quite a pleasant time. There were two young ladies there
from Virginia whose names I do not know, Dr. Augustine
Smith's daughter, myself, Mr. Galliher, Mr. Rainsford, Mr.
Bannister and Mr. Pendleton [John Pendleton of Fredericksburg,
Virginia]. I was introduced to the latter and
liked him quite well. I had a long talk with him. His
manners are entirely too coquettish to suit me; he does nothing
but shrug his shoulders and roll up his eyes&mdash;perhaps
it is a Virginia custom. He seems to think Miss Gerard
[Julia, daughter of James W. Gerard] his <i>belle</i> ideal or
<i>beau</i> ideal of everything lovely, etc. I told him that I
thought her awful, that she had such an inanimate sickly
expression, and I abused her at a great rate! I expect
he thinks I am a regular devil!</p>

<p>Tonight I am going to the opera. "Lucretia Borgia"
is to be performed. I have learned a song from Lucia.
So you can imagine how much the rooster has improved!</p>

<p>On Thursday evening I was at the Moore's [Dr. William
Moore]. Frank Bucknor came for me and brought
me home. His sister [Cornelia Bucknor, subsequently the
wife of Professor John Howard Van Amringe of Columbia
College] was there, Beek Fish [Beekman Fish], Bayard
Fish, Dr. [Adolphus] Follin, old Leslie Irving and Frank
Van Rensselaer. Miss Moore told me that May came for
us that evening to go to the Academy. I am dreadfully
sorry that you will not be able to go to the Kemble [Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
William Kemble] ball; they are going to have it on Monday.
I dare say it will be very pleasant and old Chrystie
will be there. Emily B. [Emily Bucknor] and Frank
[Bucknor] are going.</p>

<p>My hat has come home, and it is very pretty; it is a
sherred blue crape, without any ribbon&mdash;trimmed very
simply with blue crape and illusion mixed and the same
inside.</p>

<p>Mrs. William Le Roy has been to see you. Ma thinks
that you had better come home when you first expected&mdash;on
Tuesday or Wednesday. I am very much disappointed
that you are not here to go to the Kembles as you have a
dress to wear.</p>

<p>You can tell Adeline [Adeline Camilla Scott], if you
please, that Mr. Pendleton wants to know the use of sending
her to school when her head is filled with beaux and
parties. I told him her mother did it to keep her out of
mischief. Bucknor says he thinks it is time for you to
come home. If you stay much longer my spring fever
will come on and I shall get so many things there will be
no money left for you. Besides Mr. Pendleton is going to
the Bucknor's some day next week and I am going to get
him to stop for me, and if you are home I shall invite you
to go along. Beek Fish will be there the same evening
with his flute. He told Emily B. that his sister [Mrs.
Thomas Pym Remington of Philadelphia] had written them
that you had been in Philadelphia and that she was so delighted
to see you.</p>

<p>Leslie Irving told me that he had seen a letter in the
Commercial Advertiser from Thomas Turner [subsequently
Rear Admiral Turner, U.S.N.] to Hamilton Fish.
He thought of sending it to you, but he thought some one
else had probably done so. I hear that they [the Fishes]
are to have a party. The Bankheads [General James
Bankhead's daughters] are going to spend the summer at
West Point. Pa and Jim are better. Pa rode out yesterday
and walked out to-day. He has been in a great
state of excitement about General Scott. It was reported
two days ago that he was killed and he was afraid it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
true. Vera Cruz, I believe, is taken. I cannot write any
longer, I'm so tired. I will send Cornelia's [Cornelia
Scott] purse by H. Forbes [Harriet Forbes, Mrs. Colhoun
of Philadelphia].</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">M. Campbell.</span></p>

<p>Saturday April 10th.</p>

<p>Pa thinks it is time for you to come home. Do you
know of any opportunity? I shall not send anything to
you. You see you never will take my advice in anything.
I told you to bring your pink dress with you but you
would not. I suppose I shall not hear from you again.
Pa says you can do as you please about staying longer.</p></div>

<p>Elizabeth, New Jersey, was a quaint old town whose inhabitants
seemed almost exclusively made up of Barbers,
Ogdens and Chetwoods, with a sprinkling of De Harts.
There was a steamboat plying between Elizabethport
(now a part of the City of Elizabeth) and New York,
and we were its frequent patrons. Ursino, the country
seat of the Kean family, then as now was one of the historic
places of the neighborhood. As I remember the
beautiful old home, it was occupied by John Kean, father
of the late senior U.S. Senator from New Jersey. At
an earlier period the latter's great-grandfather had married
Susan Livingston, a daughter of Peter Van Brough
Livingston of New York, and resided at Ursino. After
the death of her husband she married Count Julian
Niemcewicz, who was called the "Shakespeare of Poland"
and who came to America with Kosciusco, upon whose
staff he had served. She was also the grandmother of
Mrs. Hamilton Fish. Another noted estate in the same general
neighborhood, was "Abyssinia," owned and occupied
for a long period by the Ricketts family, whose walls were
highly decorated by one of its artistic members. I am informed
that it still stands but that it is used, alas, for
mechanical purposes!</p>

<p>I recall with intense pleasure another of my visits to
New Jersey when I was a guest at the home of General
and Mrs. Scott in Elizabeth. Isabella Cass of Detroit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
daughter of General Lewis Cass, was also there at the
same time. She attended school in Paris while her father
was Minister to France and received other educational advantages
quite unusual for women at that time. While
residing in Washington at a subsequent period she was regarded
as one of the reigning belles. She married a member
of the Diplomatic Corps from the Netherlands and
lived and died abroad. A constant visitor of the Scott
family whom I recall with great pleasure was Thomas
Turner, subsequently an Admiral in our Navy. He was
a Virginian by birth and a near relative of General Robert
E. Lee; but, though possessing the blood of the Carters,
he remained during the Civil War loyal to the national
flag. His wife was Frances Hailes Palmer of "Abyssinia."</p>

<p>Still another guest of the Scotts in Elizabeth was the
erratic but decidedly brilliant Doctor William Starbuck
Mayo. Although Mrs. Scott was a Mayo, they were not
related. He was from the northern part of the State of
New York, while Mrs. Scott, as is well known, was from
Virginia. Doctor Mayo, however, was an ardent admirer
of Mrs. Scott and made the fact apparent in much that
he said and did. He was the author of several works,
one of which was a romance entitled "Kaloolah," which
he dedicated to Mrs. Scott. When I met him in Washington
he was on his first bridal tour, although pretty well
advanced in years. His bride was Mrs. Henry Dudley of
New York, whose maiden name was Helen Stuyvesant.
She was the daughter of Nicholas William Stuyvesant and
one of the heirs of the large estate of Peter G. Stuyvesant.
During Van Buren's administration, Doctor Mayo was a
social light in Washington.</p>

<p>There was another Dr. Mayo&mdash;Robert Mayo of Richmond&mdash;who,
in some respects, created a temporary commotion
in public life in Washington and elsewhere. He
was a Virginian by birth, and at one time figured prominently
as a politician. He engaged in the presidential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
campaign of 1828 as an ardent partisan of General Jackson
and during that period edited in Richmond the
<i>Jackson Democrat</i>. He subsequently, however, parted
company with his presidential idol, and in 1839 published
a volume entitled, "Political Sketches of Eight
Years in Washington," which is almost exclusively devoted
to an arraignment of General Jackson's administration.
In an original letter now before me, written by
Martin Van Buren to Governor William C. Bouck, of
New York, which has never before appeared in print, he
speaks in an amusing manner of Dr. Mayo. I insert the
whole letter, as his allusions to General Jackson are of
exceptional interest. No one can well deny that the parting
admonition of Polonius to his son Laertes is a masterpiece
of human wisdom, but this letter of the "Sage of
Lindenwald" to Governor Bouck reveals ability by no
means inferior to that of this wise councilor of Denmark.</p>

<p class='center'>Confidential.</p>

<p class='right'>Lindenwald,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Jan<sup>y</sup>. 17th 1843.</p>

<p>My dear Sir,</p>

<p>I embrace the occasion of a short visit of my son Major
Van Buren to Albany before he goes South to drop you a
few lines. Although I have not admitted it in my conversations
with those who are given to croaking, and thus
alarm our friends, I have nevertheless witnessed with the
keenest regret the distractions among our friends at Albany;
&amp; more particularly in relation to the state printing.
It is certainly a lamentable winding up of a great
contest admirably conducted &amp;, as we supposed, gloriously
terminated. Without undertaking to decide who is
right or who is wrong, and much less to take any part in
the unfortunate controversy, I cannot but experience great
pain from the eying of so bitter a controversy in the face
of the enemy among those who once acted together so honorably
&amp; so usefully, and for all of whom I have so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
reason to cherish feelings of respect &amp; regard. Permit
me to make one suggestion, &amp; that relates to the importance
of a speedy decision, one way or the other. Nothing
is so injurious in such cases as delay. It is almost
better to decide wrong than to protract the contest. Every
day makes new enemies &amp; increases the animosities of
those who have already become so, &amp; extends them to
other subjects; and yet nothing is so natural as to desire
to put off the decision of controversies among friends.
Most happy would I be to find that you had been able to
mitigate, if not altogether to obviate, existing difficulties
by providing places for one or more of the competitors in
other branches of the public service to which they are
adapted &amp; with which they would be as well satisfied.</p>

<p>It has afforded me unfeigned satisfaction to learn, as
I do from all quarters, that you keep your own secrets in
regard to appointments, &amp; don't feed every body with
promises or what they construe into promises&mdash;a practice
which so many public men are apt to fall into, &amp; by which
they make themselves more trouble &amp; subject themselves
to more discredit than they dream of. Persevere in that
course, consider carefully every case &amp; make the selection
which your own unbiassed judgment designates as the
best, &amp; above all let the people see as clear as day that you
do not yield yourself to, or make battle against, any cliques
or sections of the party, but act in good faith and to the
best of your ability for the good of the whole, and you
may be assured that the personal discontents which you
would to some extent occasion, if you had the wisdom of
Solomon &amp; were pure as an angel, will do you no harm &amp;
be exceedingly evanescent in their duration. The Democratic
is a reasonable &amp; a just party &amp; more than half of
the business is done when they are satisfied that the man
they have elected means to do right. The difficulty with
a new administration is in the beginning. At the start
little matters may create a distrust which it will take a
series of good acts to remove. But once a favourable impression
is made &amp; the people become satisfied that the
right thing is intended, it takes great errors, often re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>peated,
to create a counter current. Will you excuse me
if, from a sincere desire for your success, I go farther &amp;
touch upon matters not political, or at least not wholly
so? Your situation of course excites envy &amp; jealousy on
the part of some. It is impossible from the character of
man that it should be otherwise, bear yourself ever so
meekly &amp; you cannot avoid it. There will therefore in
Albany, as well as elsewhere, be people who will make ill
natured remarks &amp; there will be still more who will make
it their business, in the hope of benefitting themselves, to
bring you exaggerated accounts of what is said, and if
they lack materials they will tell you, if they find that you
like to listen to small things, a great deal that never has
been said. It is my deliberate opinion that these mischievous
gossips cause public men more vexation, yes, ten
fold, than all the cares &amp; anxieties of office taken together.
I have seen perhaps as much of this as any man of my
age, &amp; claim to be a competent judge of the evil &amp; its
remedies. The greatest fault I ever saw in our excellent
friend Gen<sup>l</sup>. Jackson, was the facility with which (in carrying
out his general principle that it was the duty
of the President to hear all) he leant his ear, though not
his confidence, to such people. Though very sagacious &amp;
very apt to put the right construction upon all such revelations,
it was still evident that he was every day more or
less annoyed by them. I endeavored to satisfy him of the
expediency of shutting their mouths, but did not succeed,
&amp; I am as sure as I can be of any such thing that if the
truth could be known it would appear that he had experienced
more annoyance from such sources than from all
the severe trials through which he had to pass &amp; did pass
with such unfading glory. Having his case before me, I
determined to profit by the experience I had acquired in
so good a school. I had no sooner taken possession of the
White House than I was beset by these harpies. The way
in which I treated the whole crew, with variations of
course according to circumstances, will appear from the
following dialogue in a single case. The celebrated Dr.
Mayo called upon me &amp; in his stuttering &amp; mysterious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
way commenced by asking when he could have a few minutes
very private conversation with me. Knowing the
man, I anticipated his business &amp; told him now, I will
hear you now. He then told me he had discovered a conspiracy
to destroy me politically the particulars of which
he felt it to be his duty to lay before [me]. I replied instantly,
&amp; somewhat sternly, Dr., I do not wish to hear
them. I have irrefragable proof, he replied. I don't
care, was the response. It is in writing, Sir, said he. I
won't look at it, Sir. What, said he, don't you want to
see it if it is in writing &amp; genuine? An emphatic No,
Sir, closed the conversation. The Dr. raised his eyes and
hands as if he thought me demented, &amp; making a low bow
&amp; ejaculating a long Hah-hah retreated for the door. The
story about the Dr. got out and, partly by mine &amp; I believe
in part also by his means, &amp; alarmed all the story
tellers who heard of it. A few repetitions of the same
dose to others impressed the whole crew with a conviction
that nothing was to be gained by bringing such reports to
me. The consequence was that although Washington is
perhaps the most gossiping place in the world, I escaped
its contamination altogether, and had no trouble except
such as unavoidably grew out of my public duties; and
although I had perhaps a more vexatious time than any
of my predecessors in that respect I was the only man, they
all say, who grew fat in that office.</p>

<p>I was happy to learn from my son John by a letter received
yesterday the high opinion he entertains of your
discreet &amp; honorable bearing in the midst of the difficulties
by which you are beset. I hope he &amp; Smith, [another
son of Martin Van Buren], exercise the discretion by
which their course has heretofore been governed, in meddling
as little with things political that do not belong to
them as possible. They know that such is my wish, as
any contest there must necessarily be more or less between
my friends; and I shall be obliged to you to give them
from time to time such advice upon the subject as you
may think proper. Be assured that they will take it in
good part. You may, if you please, at your convenience,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
return me the suggestions I sent you, as I may have occasion
to weave some parts of them into letters that I am
frequently obliged to write; the rough draft was made
with a pencil &amp; is now illegible. Be assured that your not
using them occasioned me no mortification, as I before told
you it would not. You had a nearer &amp; could take a safer
view of things than myself. Don't trouble yourself to answer
this letter as it requires none; only excuse me for
writing you one so unmercifully long.</p>

<p>Remember me kindly to Mrs. Bouck, &amp; believe me to
be</p>

<p class='indent3'>Very sincerely your friend,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">M. Van Buren</span>.</p>

<p>His Excellency,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wm. C. Bouck.</p>

<p>In 1850 General and Mrs. Scott moved to Washington
and Hampton was closed for many years. They
lived in one of the houses built by Count De Menou,
French Minister to this country from 1822 to 1824, on H
Street, between Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets, on
the present site of the Epiphany Parish House. These
residences were commonly called the "chain buildings,"
owing to the fact that their fences were made almost entirely
of iron chains. Two of them, thrown into one,
were occupied by the Scotts and were owned by my
father-in-law, Samuel L. Gouverneur, senior. In the
third, the property of Mrs. Beverly Kennon, lived the
venerable Mrs. Alexander Hamilton and her only daughter,
Mrs. Hamilton Holly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>SOCIAL LEADERS IN WASHINGTON LIFE</h3>


<p>I passed many delightful hours in the Washington
home of General Scott and had a standing invitation
to come and go as I pleased. Upon his return from
the war with Mexico, crowned with the laurels of victory,
he immediately became one of the most prominent lions
of the day. He had successfully invaded a practically
unknown country reeking with the terrible <i>vomito</i>, a
disease upon which the Mexicans relied to kill their foes
more expeditiously than ammunition, and had well
earned for himself the plaudits of a grateful country. I
distinctly remember that he received flattering letters
from the Duke of Wellington and other distinguished foreigners
congratulating him upon his military success.
His headquarters were now established in Washington,
and his house became one of the most prominent social
centers of the National Capital. About this time Mrs.
Scott was much in New York, where her third daughter,
Marcella, subsequently Mrs. Charles Carroll McTavish, was
attending school, and consequently her daughter Cornelia,
who not long before had married her father's aide, Henry
Lee Scott of North Carolina, was virtually mistress of the
establishment. Mrs. Henry Lee Scott's social sway in
Washington was almost unprecedented. She was as grand
in appearance as she was in character, and during one of
her visits to Rome she sat for a distinguished artist as a
model for his pictures of the Madonna. General Scott
seemed to derive much pleasure and satisfaction from the
society of his former companions in arms, who were al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>ways
welcomed to his hospitable board. Among those I
especially recall were Colonels John Abert, Roger Jones,
William Turnbull and Ichabod B. Crane, whose son, Dr.
Charles H. Crane, later became Surgeon General of the
Army. These occasions were especially delightful to me
as a young woman, and I always regarded it as an exceptional
privilege to be present.</p>

<p>The Whig party meanwhile nominated General Scott
for the presidency. The opposing candidate was Franklin
Pierce. One day during the campaign Scott, in replying
to a note addressed to him by William L. Marcy, Secretary
of War in Polk's cabinet, began his note: "After a
hasty plate of soup"&mdash;supposing that his note would be
regarded as personal. Marcy, who was a keen political
foe, was too astute a politician, however, not to take advantage
of the chance to make Scott appear ridiculous.
He classified the note as official, and the whole country
soon resounded with it. I saw General Scott when he returned
from his Mexican campaign, covered with glory,
to confront his political enemies at home, and I was also
with him in 1852 when the announcement arrived that he
had been defeated as a presidential candidate. Were I
called upon to decide in which character he appeared to
the greater advantage, that of the victor or the vanquished,
I should unhesitatingly give my verdict to the latter.
There was a grandeur in his bearing under the adverse circumstances
with which the success and glamour of arms
could not compare.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Smith Pyne, the beloved rector of St. John's
Episcopal Church, often mingled with the distinguished
guests gathered at the residence of General Scott. He
was full of life and fun and good cheer and would even
dare, when occasion offered, to aim his jokes and puns at
General Scott himself. At one of the General's dinners,
for example, while the soup was being served, he addressed
him as "Marshal <i>Turenne</i>." It is said that upon one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
occasion, when the good rector failed by polite efforts to
dismiss a book-agent, he was regretfully compelled to order
him from his house. "Your cloth protects you," said the
offended agent. "The cloth protects <i>you</i>," replied Dr.
Pyne, "and it will not protect you long if you do not
leave this instant." In spite of this incident, it was well
known that the Doctor had a tender and sympathetic
nature. After he had officiated at the funerals of
his parishioners it is said that his wife was frequently
compelled to exert all her efforts to arouse him from his
depression. About this same period, Ole Bull, the great
Norwegian violinist who was second only to Paganini,
was receiving an enthusiastic reception from audiences
"panting for the music which is divine." Upon this particular
evening Dr. Pyne sat next to me, when he suddenly
exclaimed: "If honorary degrees were conferred upon
musicians, Ole Bull would be Fiddle D.D." At another
time, when Dr. Edward Maynard, a well-known Washington
dentist, was remodeling his residence on Pennsylvania
Avenue, now a portion of the Columbia Hospital, Dr. Pyne
was asked to what order of architecture it belonged and replied:
"<i>Tusk-can</i>, I suppose,"&mdash;a pretty poor pun, but no
worse, perhaps, than most of those one hears nowadays.
The Rev. Dr. Pyne performed the marriage ceremony, at
the "chain buildings," of General Scott's second daughter,
Adeline Camilla, and Goold Hoyt of New York. It was a
quiet wedding and only the members of the family were
present. I remember the bride as one of the most beautiful
women I have ever known; her face reminded me of
a Roman cameo.</p>

<p>General Scott was something of an epicure. I have
seen him sit down to a meal where jowl was the principal
dish, and have heard his exclamation of appreciation
caused in part, possibly, by his recollection of similar
fare in other days in Virginia. He did the family
marketing personally, and was very discriminating in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
his selection of food. Terrapin, which he insisted upon
pronouncing t<i>a</i>rrapin, was his favorite dish, and he would
order oysters by the barrel from Norfolk. On one occasion
he attended a banquet where all the States of the
Union were represented by a dish in some way characteristic
of each commonwealth. Pennsylvania was represented
by a bowl of sauer-kraut; and in speaking of the
fact the next morning the General remarked: "I partook
of it with tears in my eyes."</p>

<p>New Year's day in Washington was a festive occasion,
especially in the home where I was a guest. General and
Mrs. Scott kept open house and of course most of the
Army officers stationed in Washington, and some from the
Navy, called to pay their respects. All appeared in full-dress
uniform, and a bountiful collation was served. I
was present at several of these receptions and recall that
after the festivities of the day were nearly over General
Scott, who of course had paid his respects to the President
earlier in the day, always called upon two venerable women&mdash;Mrs.
"Dolly" Madison, who then lived in the house
now occupied by the Cosmos Club, and Mrs. Alexander
Hamilton, his next door neighbor. During the
winter of 1850, which I spent with the Scotts, I participated
with them in the various social enjoyments of
the season.</p>

<p>Early in the month of January, 1851, and not long
after the re-assembling of Congress, that genial gentleman,
William W. Corcoran, gave his annual ball to both Houses
of Congress, and it was in many ways a notable entertainment.
As this was long previous to the erection of his
public art gallery, his house was filled with many paintings
and pieces of statuary. Powers's "Greek slave,"
which now occupies a conspicuous place in the Corcoran
Art Gallery, stood in the drawing-room. General Scott did
not care especially for large evening entertainments, but
he always attended those of Mr. Corcoran. In this in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>stance
I was the only member of the household who accompanied
him, and the ovation that awaited his arrival
was enthusiastic; and as I entered the ballroom with him I
received my full share of attention. Among the prominent
guests was General "Sam" Houston, arrayed in his blue
coat, brass buttons and ruffled shirt. His appearance was
patrician and his courtesy that of the inborn gentleman.
I once laughingly remarked to General Scott that General
Houston in some ways always recalled to me the personal
appearance of General Washington. His facetious rejoinder
was: "Was ever the Father of his Country so
defamed?" I met at this entertainment for the first
time Charles Sumner, who had but recently taken his seat
in the U.S. Senate and of whom I shall speak hereafter.
Caleb Cushing was also there, and Cornelia Marcy, the
beautiful daughter of William L. Marcy, was one of the
belles of the ball. I have stated that General Scott did
not generally attend evening entertainments; in his own
way, however, he took great interest in all social events,
and upon my return from parties, sometimes at a very
late hour, I have often found him awaiting my account
of what had transpired.</p>

<p>I have spoken of General Houston's appearance. I
now wish to refer to his fine sense of honor. He was married
on the 22d of January, 1829, to Miss Eliza Allen,
daughter of Colonel John Allen, from near Gallatin, the
county town of Sumner county in Tennessee, and separated
from her directly after the marriage ceremony
under, as is said, the most painful circumstances. The
wedding guests had departed and General Houston and
his bride were sitting alone by the fire, when he suddenly
discovered that she was weeping. He asked the cause of
her tears and was told by her that she had never loved
him and never could, but had married him solely to please
her father. "I love Doctor Douglas," she added, "but I
will try my best and be a dutiful wife to you." "Miss,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
said Governor Houston, even waiving the fact that he had
just married her, "no white woman shall be my slave;
good-night." It is said that he mounted his horse and
rode to Nashville where he resigned at once his office as
Governor and departed for the Cherokee country, where
and elsewhere his subsequent career is well known. Having
procured a divorce from his wife, he married Margaret
Moffette in the spring of 1840.</p>

<p>During the same winter I attended a party given by
Mrs. Clement C. Hill, as a "house-warming," at her residence
on H Street. Many years later George Bancroft,
the historian, occupied this residence and it is still called
the "Bancroft house." Mr. Hill was a member of a
prominent Maryland family which owned large estates in
Prince George County, and his wife was recognized as one
of the social leaders in Washington.</p>

<p>Another ball which I recall, which I attended in company
with the Scotts, was given by Colonel and Mrs. William
G. Freeman at their residence on F Street, near Thirteenth
Street, the former of whom was at one time Chief
of Staff to General Scott. I well remember that General
Scott accompanied his daughter and me and that he wore
at the time the full-dress uniform of his high rank. As
he measured six feet four in his stocking-feet, the imposing
nature of his appearance cannot well be described.
Mrs. Freeman, whose maiden name was Margaret Coleman,
was one of the joint owners of the Cornwall coal
mines in Pennsylvania. Her sister, Miss Sarah Coleman,
shared her house for many years, and old Washingtonians
remember her as the "Lady Bountiful" whose whole life
was devoted to good works. Colonel and Mrs. Freeman's
two daughters, Miss Isabel Freeman and Mrs. Benjamin
F. Buckingham, still reside in Washington.</p>

<p>The first guest whom I recall at this ball was the
sprightly Mary Louisa Adams. She made her home with
her grandfather, John Quincy Adams, who lived in one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the two white houses on F Street, between Thirteenth and
Fourteenth Streets, now called the "Adams house." She
was the venerable ex-President's principal heir, and subsequently
married her relative, William Clarkson Johnson
of Utica. George B. McClellan was also a guest at this
entertainment as one of the young beaux. His presence
made an indelible impression upon my memory as I was
dancing a cotillion with him when, to my nervous horror,
the pictures in the ballroom began to spin and I made myself
conspicuous by nearly fainting. I did not, however,
lose consciousness like the heroines of the old tragedies,
and was conducted to a retired seat where, at the request
of General Scott, I was attended by Dr. Richard Henry
Coolidge, Surgeon in the Army, who was also a guest.
General Scott's admiration for this distinguished gentleman,
personally as well as professionally, was very great.
I have often heard the General say that Dr. Coolidge not
only prescribed for the physical condition of his patients
but also by the example of his Christian character elevated
their moral tone. He concluded his eulogy with the
words: "Dr. Coolidge walks humbly before his God."
His widow, Mrs. Harriet Morris Coolidge, daughter of
Commodore Charles Morris, U.S.N., one of the distinguished
heroes of the War of 1812, is still living in Washington.
I occasionally see her in her pleasant home on L
Street where she welcomes a large circle of friends, giving
one amid her pleasant surroundings a pleasing picture
of a serene old age.</p>

<p>During my many visits to the Scott household after the
Mexican War, I always occupied a comfortable brass camp
bedstead which had formerly belonged to the Mexican
General, Santa Anna. It seems that just after the battle
of Cerro Gordo this warrior made a hasty flight, leaving
behind him his camp furniture and even, it is said, his
wooden leg. This bedstead was captured as a trophy of
war, and finally came into General Scott's possession.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
The memory of this man's brutal deeds, however, never
disturbed my midnight repose. Texas history tells the
story of the Alamo and of the six brave men there put to
death by his orders, suggesting in a certain degree the
atrocities of the Duke of Cumberland of which I have already
spoken. Santa Anna, however, had Indian blood
in his veins&mdash;an extenuating circumstance that cannot be
offered in defense of the "Butcher of Culloden."</p>

<p>There was always more or less gossip afloat concerning
the alleged strained relations existing between General
and Mrs. Scott, owing largely to the fact that the conditions
attending and surrounding their respective lives were
fundamentally different and often misunderstood. General
Scott was a born commander while <i>Madame la G&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>
from her earliest life had had the world at her feet.
Such a combination naturally resulted in an occasional
discordant note, which unfortunately was usually sounded
in public. Their private life, however, was serene, and
they were invariably loyal to each other's interests.
When Mrs. Scott, for example, learned that James
Lyon of Richmond, an intimate friend of the General and
herself and a trustee for certain of her property, had, although
a Whig, voted against her husband when a presidential
candidate, she at once revoked his trusteeship. At
another time she wrote some attractive lines which she
feelingly dedicated to her husband.</p>

<p>I recall an amusing incident related by General Scott
just after a journey to Virginia that well illustrates the
exigencies that awaited persons traveling in those days in
carriages. For a brief period before the inauguration of
President Harrison, General Scott was in Richmond, and
in due time, as he thought, started for the station to catch
a train for Washington to be present when the President-elect
should take his oath of office. He missed the train,
however, and immediately secured a carriage to convey him
to Washington, as his presence there was imperative; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
after a hard day's journey the horses could go no further,
and he was obliged to seek shelter for the night. Stopping
at a house near the roadside and inquiring whether
he could be accommodated, he was told that there was but
one vacant room and that it had been engaged some days
in advance by a German butcher, accompanied by his
wife and daughter. This party meanwhile arrived and
upon being informed of General Scott's predicament generously
offered to share the room with him. It was arranged
that the women should occupy one of the beds
and General Scott and the butcher the other. The
women, after retiring early, gave the signal, "All
right," when the men took possession of the second bed.
After some pretty fast traveling the next morning, General
Scott reached his destination. While he was relating
this laughable experience to us some years later, I
inquired whether he had enjoyed a comfortable rest.
"No," was his emphatic response, "the butcher snored
the whole night." During this visit to Richmond, General
Scott was invited by an old friend to accompany her
and her two sisters to a Roman Catholic church to hear
some fine music. Upon arriving at the door they were
met by the sexton, who, somewhat flurried by seeing General
Scott, announced in stentorian tones the advent of
the strangers&mdash;"three cheers (chairs) for the Protestant
ladies."</p>

<span class="caption">Brigadier General Winfield Scott, U.S.A., by Ingham.<br /></span>
<span class='caption2'><i>The original portrait was burned many years ago.</i></span>
</div>

<p>While I am relating Scott anecdotes, I must not
omit to speak of an amusing experience the old General
was fond of relating which occurred while he was
traveling in the West. In his official capacity he was a
sojourner for a short period in Cincinnati, and, upon leaving
that now prosperous city, he directed that P.P.C.
cards be sent to all persons who had called upon him. It
seems that the social <i>convenances</i> had not yet dawned upon
this city, now the abode of arts and sciences, as the town
wiseacre, learned in many things as well as social lore, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
called upon for an elucidation of the three mysterious letters.
Apparently he was not as able an exponent as was
Daniel at Balshazzar's feast, who so readily deciphered
"the handwriting on the wall." He construed the letters
to signify <i>pour prendre caf&eacute;</i>, an invitation which was
gladly accepted, much to General Scott's astonishment,
who decided then and there to confine himself in future to
plain English.</p>

<p>The charming old resident society predominated in those
days in the District of Columbia, and wealth was not a
controlling influence in social life. The condition of society
was, therefore, different from that of to-day, when
apparently the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... strongest castle, tower or town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden bullet beateth down.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The old Washingtonians are now sometimes designated as
"cave dwellers," and, generally speaking, the public bows
to the golden calf. The term "old Washingtonians," as
now used, applies to residents descended from the original
settlers of Maryland and Virginia, as well as to Presidential
families and the representatives of Army and
Navy officers of earlier days. Their social code is, in some
respects, entirely different and distinct from that of any
other city, and was formed many decades ago by the ancestors
of the "cave dwellers," who were so peculiarly
versed in the varied requirements and adornments of
social life that to-day no radical innovations are acceptable
to their descendants.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Army and Navy, I am reminded of an
amusing anecdote which has been generally circulated regarding
the wife of a wealthy manufacturer from a small
western town who, after building a handsome home in the
heart of a fashionable section of the city, announced that
her visiting list was growing so large that she must in
some way reduce it and that she had decided to "draw it"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
on the Army and Navy. It seems almost needless to say
that this remark created much unfavorable comment, as
Washington is especially proud of the Army and Navy
officers she has nurtured.</p>

<p>Among the families who were socially prominent at the
National Capital when I first knew it, were the Seatons,
Gales, Lees, Freemans, Carrolls, Turnbulls, Hagners, Tayloes,
Ramsays, Millers, Hills, Gouverneurs, Maynadiers,
Grahams, Woodhulls, Jesups, Watsons, Nicholsons, Warringtons,
Aberts, Worthingtons, Randolphs, Wilkes, Wainwrights,
Roger Jones, Pearsons, McBlairs, Farleys, Cutts,
Walter Jones, Porters, Emorys, Woodburys, Dickens,
Pleasantons, McCauleys, and Mays.</p>

<p>I often recall with pleasure the days spent by me at
Brentwood, a fine old country seat near Washington, and
picture to my mind those forms of "life and light" arrayed
in the charms of simplicity which were there portrayed.
The far West had not then poured its coffers into
the National Capital, and the mining element of California
was then unknown. It is true that Washington, with its
unpaved streets and poorly lighted thoroughfares, was
then in a primitive condition, but it is just as true that its
social tone has never been surpassed. Brentwood was the
residence of Mrs. Joseph Pearson, who dispensed its hospitalities
with ease and elegance. For many years it was
a social <i>El Dorado</i>, where resident society and distinguished
strangers were always welcome. Although it was
then remote from the heart of the city, most of its numerous
visitors were inclined to linger, once within its walls,
to enjoy the charmed circle which surrounded the Pearson
family. Both the daughters of this house, Eliza, who married
Carlisle P. Patterson, Superintendent of the U.S.
Coast Survey, and Josephine, who became the wife of
Peter Augustus Jay of New York, were Washington beauties.
Their social arena, however, was not confined to this
city, as they made frequent visits to New York, where they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
were regarded as great belles. Christine Kean, an old
friend of mine who was a younger sister of Mrs. Hamilton
Fish, both of whom were daughters of Peter Philip James
Kean of New Jersey, was intimate with the "Pearson
girls," and made frequent visits to Brentwood, where she
shared in their social reign. Christine Kean married William
Preston Griffin, a naval officer from Virginia, who
survived their marriage for only a few years. I was accustomed
to call her "sunshine" as she carried joy and
gladness to every threshold she crossed. She was superintendent
of nurses in the sanitary corps during the Civil
War, and as such rendered conspicuous service in the
State of Virginia. She still resides in New York, admired
and beloved by a large circle of friends, and those charming
traits of character which have always made her so
universally beloved are now hallowing the declining years
of her life.</p>

<p>I often met Joseph C. G. Kennedy at General Scott's,
usually called "Census" Kennedy. One day we were
shocked to learn that Solon Borland, U.S. Senator from
Arkansas, standing high in political circles but called by
General Scott "a western ruffian," had assaulted Mr.
Kennedy and broken his nose. I knew both Mr. and Mrs.
Kennedy in after life. He was a gentleman of the old
school, beloved and respected by everyone. His death in
1887 was a shocking tragedy. A lunatic with a fancied
grievance met him on the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue
and Fifteenth Street, and stabbed him. Mr. Kennedy
was a grandson of Andrew Ellicott, who, his descendants
claim, conceived the original plans of the city of Washington
instead of Pierre Charles l'Enfant, to whom they are
generally attributed.</p>

<p>While visiting in Washington I had the pleasure of renewing
my acquaintance with Isaac Hull Adams of the
Coast Survey. He was a bachelor, and his sister, Miss
Elizabeth Combs Adams, always lived with him. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
were children of Judge Thomas Boylston Adams, a son of
President John Adams, and resided in the old Adams
homestead in Quincy, Massachusetts. I had originally
known both of them in earlier life in New York, and it
was a sincere pleasure to meet them again. Miss Adams
was a generous and broad-minded woman who inherited
the intellectuality of her ancestors. Her reminiscences of
the White House during the Monroe administration, when
her uncle, John Quincy Adams, was Secretary of State,
were of the deepest interest. She also loved to dwell upon
the days of the administration which followed, when she
was a constant visitor at the White House as the guest of
her uncle, the President. I called upon her a few years
ago in Quincy, while I was visiting in Boston, and found
her living quietly in the old home, surrounded by her
many household gods. She died soon after I saw her, but
the memory of her friendship is enduring.</p>

<p>Before making my visit to Quincy I wrote to Miss
Adams asking her whether she was equal to seeing me.
She was then nearly ninety-two years old, having been
born on the 9th of February, 1808. In a few days I received
the following letter from her own pen:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='right'><span class="smcap">21 Elm Street, Quincy, Mass.</span>, November 16, 1899.</p>

<p>My dear Mrs. Gouverneur:</p>

<p>I was very glad to receive your note saying that you
would come to see us in a few days. I am a very poor
writer, not holding the old pen of the "ready writer," and
my brother Isaac Hull is a great invalid and not able to
get about, so lame.</p>

<p>I began two or three notes to you but my fingers are so
stiff I do not hold the pen, but wish to tell you that we
shall be glad to see you. We are both tired of being invalids.
We do not forget good old times far back in the
century. The steam cars leave Boston at the South Station.
I think I sent you a letter yesterday, but if you
fail to get it, I shall be very sorry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>I have so many letters to write and can but just keep
the pen going. It is a lovely day, but I never go out now
and Isaac Hull is suffering all sorts of pains. Comes down
when he can. Sorry to send such a poor sample. I have
not been at Jamaica Plain for two years.</p>

<p>We live in the oldest house and are the oldest couple in
"all Connecticut," as Hull used to sing.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Very truly yours,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">E. C. Adams</span>.</p>

<p>As I say, the very oldest and the head of five generations.
I am so forgetful.</p></div>

<p>"Hull" Adams, as he was generally called, had a fine
tenor voice and I have frequently heard him sing in duet
with Archibald Campbell, who sang bass. Adams and
Campbell were lifelong friends and were fellow students
at West Point. The latter was graduated from West
Point in 1835 and resigned from the Army in 1838. He
subsequently became a civil engineer and was a Commissioner
to establish the boundaries between the United
States and Canada. His wife was Miss Mary Williamson
Harod of New Orleans, and a niece of Judge Thomas
B. Adams. Her father, Charles Harod, who was president
of the Atchafalaya Bank of New Orleans, was an
aide-de-camp to General Jackson at the battle of New Orleans
and, with Commodore Daniel T. Patterson in command
of our naval forces, met and arranged with the
pirate Jean Lafitte to bring in his men to fight on the
American side. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were lifelong
residents of the District, where she is especially remembered
for her many pleasing traits. Their son, Charles
H. Campbell, still resides in Washington and married a
daughter of the late Admiral David D. Porter, U.S.N.
For many years, the Archibald Campbells lived on H
Street in a house which is now a portion of The Milton.</p>

<p>I remember when Commander Matthew F. Maury,
U.S.N., the distinguished author of "The Geography of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the Sea," was stationed in the old Naval Observatory and
preparing those charts of the ocean which so gladdened
the hearts of mariners, quite unconscious meanwhile
of the sensational career which awaited him. He and
Mrs. Maury resided in Washington and, aided by their
daughters, dispensed a lavish hospitality. A few years
later, however, when Virginia seceded from the Union,
Maury resigned from the Navy and linked his destiny
with his native State. I learned much of his subsequent
career from General John Bankhead Magruder, a distant
relative of my husband, who also resigned from the service
and espoused the Southern cause. At the time of
General Lee's surrender, Maury was in England and the
following May sailed for St. Thomas, where he heard of
Lincoln's assassination. He then went to Havana, whence
he sent his son to Virginia, and took passage for Mexico.
He had approved of the efforts of the Archduke Maximilian
to establish his empire in America and had already
written him a letter expressive of his sympathy. Without
waiting, however, for a reply he followed his letter,
and upon his arrival in Mexico in June was warmly welcomed
by Maximilian, by whom he was asked to accept a
place in his Ministry; but the flattering offer was declined
and in its place he received an appointment as Director of
the Imperial Observatory. It seems superfluous to add
what everyone knows, or ought to know, that Maury was
a Christian gentleman of rare accomplishments and one
of the most proficient scientists of his day.</p>

<p>General Magruder was with Maury when they learned
of Lincoln's assassination, and accompanied him to Mexico,
where he served as Major General in Maximilian's army
until the downfall of the usurping Emperor. In referring
to his experiences in Mexico he dwelt with much emphasis
upon the Empress Carlota and her interesting personality.
He described her as especially kind and sympathetic
and as treating Maury and himself with distin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>guished
consideration at her court. This pleasing experience,
however, was not of long duration. A cloud hung
over the Mexican throne and it became apparent that Maximilian's
reign was drawing to a close. Realizing this
state of affairs, Magruder and Maury left Mexico, the
former returning to the United States while the latter
sailed for Europe. The Empress Carlota returned to
Austria, leaving Maximilian to fight alone a hopeless
cause. Louis Napoleon's vision of an European Empire
on American soil soon vanished, and Maximilian's tragic
death and Carlota's subsequent derangement caused a
throb of sympathy which was felt throughout the civilized
world.</p>

<p>During the Mexican War, General Magruder, though a
good officer and one of the bravest and most chivalrous of
men, never lost sight of his position in the <i>beau monde</i>.
He never went into battle, however pressing the emergency,
without first brushing his hair well, smoothing
his mustache and arranging his toggery after the latest
and most approved style. Often during the rage of
the battle, while the shot were raining around him like
hail and his men and horses and guns were exposed to a
destructive and merciless fire, he would stand up with his
tall, straight figure in full view of the Mexicans and, assuming
the most impressive and fashionable attitudes,
would eye the enemy through his glass with all the coolness
and grace suited to a glance through an opera glass
at a beautiful woman in an opposite box. I have always
heard that he could not be provoked by any circumstances
to commit an impolite or an ungenteel act. But he came
very near forfeiting his reputation in this respect at the
battle of Contreras. Upon being ordered to take a certain
position with his battery, he found himself exposed to a
terrible fire from the enemy's big guns. In the midst of
this hot fire, an aide of one of the generals, from whom Magruder
had not received his order to occupy this position,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
rode up to the gallant officer and told him that he had
orders for him from General &mdash;&mdash;. "But, my dear fellow,"
interrupted the polite Captain, "you must dismount
and take a glass of wine with me; do&mdash;I have some excellent
old Madeira." The aide dismounted and the wine
was hastily drunk by the impatient young Lieutenant, who
did not enjoy it very much as there was a constant fire
of grape and canister rattling about them all the
time. But Captain Magruder desired very much to have a
little agreeable chat over his wine, as, he remarked, it
was no use popping away with his diminutive pieces
against the heavy guns of the enemy. "But I am ordered
by General &mdash;&mdash; to direct you to fall back, abandon your
position, and shelter your pieces," was the impatient response.
"My dear fellow," replied the Captain, "do take
another sip of that wine&mdash;it is delicious!" "But you are
ordered by General &mdash;&mdash; to retire, Captain; and you are
being cut up." "Much obliged to you, my dear friend,
but if you will only make yourself comfortable for a few
minutes, I will get some sardines and crackers." "I must
go," impatiently remarked the Lieutenant, mounting his
horse; "what shall I report to the General?" "Well, my
dear fellow, if you are determined to go, please present my
compliments to General &mdash;&mdash; and tell him that, owing to
a previous engagement with General &mdash;&mdash;, I am under
the necessity of informing him that before I leave this
spot I will see him in the neighborhood of a certain gentleman
whose name is not to be mentioned in polite society."
So, at all events, goes the story, and I presume
we may believe as much or as little of it as we please.</p>

<p>General Magruder, while our guest in our country home
near Frederick, in Maryland, related to me many interesting
incidents connected with Maury's career. The General
seemed to possess an unusual appreciation of the
good things of life and told me with much gusto about the
numerous delicacies with which Mexico abounded. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
descriptions served to recall to my mind the fact that when
he was in our regular army he had the reputation of
"faring sumptuously every day." When in command at
Newport, Rhode Island, he gave a ball, during which he
employed the services of some of the soldiers under his
command for domestic purposes, and for this act was
reprimanded by the War Department. After the Civil
War he went to Texas and died in Houston in the winter
of 1871. He was a brave soldier and was twice brevetted
for gallantry and meritorious conduct on the battlefields
of the Mexican War.</p>

<p>General John B. Magruder and his brother, Captain
George A. Magruder of the Navy, who early in life became
orphans, were brought up by their maternal uncle,
General James Bankhead, U.S.A. General "Jack" Magruder,
as he was usually called, developed rather lively
traits of character, while his younger brother George was
so deeply religious that, during his naval career, his nickname
was "St. George of the Navy." When both young
men had reached manhood, General Bankhead read them
a homily, having special reference, however, to his nephew
"Jack." "I have reared you both with the utmost care
and circumspection," he said, "but you, John, have not
my approval in many ways." Jack's response was characteristic.
"Uncle," he said, "I can account for it in the
following manner&mdash;George has followed your precepts,
but I have followed your example." At the outbreak of
the Civil War, Captain Magruder resigned from the Navy
and went with his family to Canada, where his daughter
Helen married James York MacGregor Scarlett, whose
title of nobility was Lord Abinger, his father having been
raised to the peerage as a "lower Lord."</p>

<p>Another Virginia family of social prominence, whose
members mingled much in Washington society while I
was still visiting the Winfield Scotts, was that of the Masons
of "Colross," the name of their old homestead near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Alexandria in Virginia. Mrs. Thomson F. Mason was usually
called Mrs. "Colross" Mason to distinguish her from
another family by the same name, that of James M. Mason,
United States Senator from Virginia. The family thought
nothing of the drive to Washington, and no entertainment
was quite complete without the "Mason girls,"
who were especially bright and attractive young women.
Open house was kept at this delightful country seat and
many were the pleasant parties given there. One of the
daughters, Matilda, married Charles H. Rhett, a representative
South Carolinian, and my friend, Cornelia Scott, was
one of her bridesmaids. Florence, another sister, who was
generally called "Folly," married Captain Thomas G.
Rhett of the Army, a brother of her sister's husband. He
resigned at the beginning of the Civil War, as a South
Carolinian would indeed have been a <i>rara avis</i> in the
Federal Army in 1861, and became an officer in the Confederate
Army; while from 1870 to 1873 he was a Colonel
of Ordnance in the Army of the Khedive. Miss Betty
Mason, the oldest of these sisters, was a celebrated beauty
and became the wife of St. George Tucker Campbell of
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It was about this time I first made the acquaintance of
Emily Virginia Mason, who recently died in Georgetown
after a long and active life. We were accustomed to have
long conversations over the tea table concerning bygone
days, and I sadly miss her bright presence. Her memories
of a varied life both in Washington and Paris were highly
entertaining and as one of her auditors I never grew
weary while listening to her graphic descriptions of persons
and things. She was a daughter of John T. Mason
and a sister of Stevens Thompson Mason, the first governor
of Michigan, often called the "Boy Governor." She
was very active during the Civil War as a Confederate
nurse and continued her kindly acts thereafter in other
fields of benevolence. She wrote a life of General Robert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
E. Lee and several other books, and made a compilation
of "Southern Poems of the War," which was subsequently
published under that title.</p>

<p>One may readily turn from Emily Virginia Mason to her
life-long friend, the daughter of Senator William Wright
of New Jersey. It was during her father's official life in
Washington that Miss Katharine Maria Wright met and
married Baron Johan Cornelis Gevers, <i>Charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>
from Holland to the United States. After her marriage
she seldom visited her native country but made her home
in Holland until her death a few years ago. Her son also
entered the diplomatic service of his country and a few
years ago was living in Washington.</p>

<p>After my father's death we continued as a family to
live in our Houston Street home in New York, but in 1853
we found the character of the neighborhood, which had
been so pleasant in years gone by, changing so rapidly
that we sold our house and moved to Washington. We
secured a pleasant old-fashioned residence on G Street,
between Seventeenth and Eighteenth Streets, which in subsequent
years became the Weather Bureau. Next door to
us lived Mrs. Graham and her daughter, Mrs. Henry K.
Davenport, the grandmother and mother respectively of
Commodore Richard G. Davenport, U.S.N. Mrs. Graham
was the widow of George Graham, who, for a time during
Monroe's administration, acted as Secretary of War.
While he was serving in this capacity, his brother, John
Graham, was a member of the same cabinet, serving as
Secretary of State. Mrs. Davenport was the mother of a
family of sons known familiarly to the neighborhood as
Tom, Dick and Harry. In the same block lived Mr.
Jefferson Davis, who was then in the Senate from Mississippi.
I remember hearing Mrs. Davis say that it was
worth paying additional rent to live near Mrs. Graham,
as she had such an attractive personality and was such a
kind and attentive neighbor. A few doors the other side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of us resided Captain and Mrs. Henry C. Wayne, the
former of whom was in the Army and was the son of
James M. Wayne of Georgia, a Justice of the Supreme
Court; while across the street was the French Legation.
Next door, at the corner of G and Eighteenth Streets,
lived Edward Everett. Mr. and Mrs. Robert D. Wainwright
lived on the next block in a house now occupied
by General and Mrs. A. W. Greely. I attended the wedding
of Miss Henrietta Wainwright, soon after we arrived
in Washington, to William F. Syng of the British Legation.
She was the aunt of Rear-Admiral Richard Wainwright,
U.S.N., who, as Commanding Officer of the
<i>Gloucester</i>, rendered such conspicuous service at the battle
of Santiago. Not far away, on the corner of
Twenty-first and G Streets, lived Lieutenant Maxwell
Woodhull of the Navy and his wife; and their children
still reside in the same house. On F Street, near Twenty-first
Street, was the home of Colonel William Turnbull,
U.S.A., whose wife was a sister of General George Douglas
Ramsay, U.S.A., who was so well known to all old
Washingtonians. General Ramsay was very social in his
tastes, and many years before this time he and Columbus
Monroe were the groomsmen at the wedding at the White
House when John Adams, the son of John Quincy Adams,
married his first cousin, Miss Mary Hellen. General
and Mrs. Ramsay lived on Twenty-first Street, not
far from his sister, Mrs. William Turnbull. Mrs. John
Farley (Anna Pearson), a half-sister of Mrs. Carlisle P.
Patterson, lived on F Street, near Twenty-first Street,
and the latter's sister, Mrs. Peter Augustus Jay (Josephine
Pearson), began her matrimonial life on the northwest
corner of F and Twenty-first Streets.</p>

<p>William Thomas Carroll's residence on the corner of
Eighteenth and F Streets witnessed a continuous scene of
hospitality. Mrs. Carroll was never happier than when
entertaining. She lived to an advanced age, and until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
almost the very last, remained standing while receiving
her guests. I have heard that she retained two sets of
servants, one for the daytime and the other for the night.
In her drawing-room hung many portraits of family ancestors
arrayed in the antique dress of olden times. She
was a daughter of Governor Samuel Sprigg of Maryland
and was a handsome and accomplished woman. Her four
daughters, who materially assisted her in dispensing hospitality,
were very popular young women. Violetta Lansdale,
the oldest, married Dr. William Swann Mercer of
the well-known Virginia family; Sally is the present
Countess Esterhazy; Carrie married the late T. Dix Bolles
of the Navy; and Alida is the wife of the late John
Marshall Brown of Portland, Maine. The Carroll house
is still standing and became the residence of the late
Chief Justice Melville Fuller of the U.S. Supreme Court.
I have always heard that the Carroll house, a substantial
structure with large rooms, was built by Tench Ringgold,
who was U.S. Marshal of the District of Columbia
longer than any of his predecessors. He occupied this
position during the whole of President Monroe's administration,
and I have heard it related in the Gouverneur
family that, when Monroe was retiring from office, he asked
his successor, John Quincy Adams, on personal grounds,
to retain Mr. Ringgold. This request was granted and
Mr. Monroe made the same appeal to Andrew Jackson
shortly after the latter's inauguration, and received the
cordial response, "Don't mention it, don't mention it."
On the strength of this interview, Ringgold naturally assumed
he was safe for another term, but, to the surprise
of many, he was succeeded two years later by Henry Ashton,
who retained the office for about three years. "Old
Hickory," as everybody knows, had a mind of his own.</p>

<p>It was often very pleasant in my new surroundings to
welcome to Washington some of my early New York
friends; and among these none were more gladly received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
than Frances and Julia Kellogg of Troy. My intimacy
with these sisters goes back as far as my school days at
Madame Chegaray's, where Frances Kellogg was a boarding
pupil and in a class higher than mine when I was a
day-scholar. It was the habit of these sisters to spend
their winters in Washington and their summers at West
Point; and it was during their sojourn at the latter place
that Frances became engaged to George H. Thomas of the
Army who, although a Virginian by birth, rendered such
distinguished services during our Civil War as Commander
of the Army of the Cumberland. Many years after General
Thomas's death, his widow built a house on I Street,
where she and Miss Kellogg presided during the remainder
of their lives. During one of our many conversations,
Mrs. Thomas told me that when her husband was informed
that a house was about to be presented to him by admiring
friends, in recognition of his conspicuous services during
the Civil War, he at once declined the offer, saying
that he had been sufficiently remunerated, and requested
that the money raised for the purpose should be given in
charity. A distinguished Union General, who had already
accepted a house, remonstrated with him and said:
"Thomas, if you refuse to accept that house it will make
it awkward for us." General Thomas's characteristic response
was: "You may take as many houses as you please,
but I shall accept none."</p>

<p>At this time the house 14 Lafayette Square, now Jackson
Place, still standing but very much altered, was owned
and occupied by Purser and Mrs. Francis B. Stockton and
the latter's sister, daughters of Captain James McKnight
of the Marine Corps and nieces of Commodore Stephen
Decatur. Purser Stockton once told me that he had purchased
this home for seven thousand dollars. The house
prior to his ownership had been the residence of a number
of families of distinction, among others the Southards
and Monroes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>After giving up our home in New York I made a visit
of some weeks to my friends, the family of William Kemble,
who was still residing on St. John's Park in New
York. While there we were invited to an old-fashioned
supper at the home of Mr. Peter Goelet, a bachelor, on
the corner of Nineteenth Street and Broadway, presided
over by his sister, Mrs. Hannah Greene Gerry. Upon
the lawn of this house Mr. Goelet indulged his ornithological
tastes by a remarkable display of various species
of turkeys with their broods, together with peacocks
and silver and golden pheasants. As can be readily
understood, this was a remarkable sight in the heart
of a great city, and caused much admiration from
passers-by.</p>

<p>It has been said that at one time William W. Corcoran's
father kept a shoe store in Georgetown, and that the
son, one of the most conspicuous benefactors of the city
of Washington, was very proud of the fact. I have also
heard it said, although I cannot vouch for the truth of the
statement, that the son cherished his father's business sign
as one of his valued possessions. Whether or not these
allegations agree or conflict with the explicit statement
concerning his father made by William W. Corcoran himself,
is left for others to judge. The latter wrote concerning
his father: "Thomas Corcoran came to Baltimore
in 1783, and entered into the service of his uncle, William
Wilson, as clerk, beginning with a salary of fifty pounds
sterling a year.... He brought his family to Georgetown
and commenced the shoe and leather business on Congress
Street," etc., etc. Be the facts as they may, a witticism
of William Thomas Carroll was a <i>bon mot</i> of the
day many years ago in Washington. Upon being asked
upon one occasion whether he knew the elder Mr. Corcoran,
he replied: "I have known him from first to <i>last</i>
and from <i>last</i> to first." Mr. Carroll for thirty-six years
was Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United States, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Chief Justice Roger B. Taney paid him a well-earned
tribute when he stated that he was "an accomplished and
faithful officer, prompt and exact in business, and courteous
in manner, and during the whole period of his judicial
life discharged the duties of his office with justice to the
public and the suitors, and to the entire satisfaction of
every member of the Court."</p>

<p>At the period of which I am speaking, some of the clerical
positions in the various departments of the government
were filled by members of families socially prominent.
Francis S. Markoe and Robert S. Chew, for example, were
clerks in the State Department, and Archibald Campbell
and James Madison Cutts held similar positions. For
many years women were not employed by the government.
It is said that the first one regularly appointed was Miss
Jennie Douglas, and that she received her position through
the instrumentality of Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the
Treasury, at the request of General Francis E. Spinner,
Treasurer of the United States. She was assigned to the
duty of cutting and trimming treasury-notes, a task that
had hitherto been performed with shears by men. General
Spinner subsequently stated that her first day's work
"settled the matter in her and in women's favor."
James Madison Cutts, at one time Second Comptroller of
the Treasury under Buchanan, married Ellen Elisabeth
O'Neill, who, with her sister Rose, subsequently Mrs. Robert
Greenhow, resided in the vicinity of Washington.
Both sisters possessed much physical beauty. Madison
Cutts, as he was generally called, was a nephew of
"Dolly" Madison, and his father, Richard Cutts, was once
a Member of Congress from New Hampshire.</p>

<p>It is to the kindness of Mrs. Madison Cutts that I owe
the memory of a pleasant visit to Mrs. Madison. She
took me to call upon her one afternoon, and I shall never
forget the impression made upon me by her turban and
long earrings. Her surroundings were of a most inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>esting
character and her graceful bearing and sprightly
presence, even in extreme old age, have left a lasting picture
upon my memory. Her niece, "Dolly" Paine, was living
with her at her residence on the corner of H Street
and Madison Place, now forming a part of the Cosmos
Club. Todd Paine, her son, unfortunately did not prove
to be a source of much satisfaction to her. He survived
his mother some years and eventually the valuable Madison
manuscripts and relics became his property. At the
time of his death in Virginia this interesting collection
was brought to Washington, where, I am informed, some
of it still remains as the cherished possession of the McGuire
family. Mr. and Mrs. Madison Cutts were devotees
of society and consequently they and Mrs. Madison met
upon common ground. The afternoon of my memorable
visit to this former mistress of the White House I remember
meeting quite a number of visitors in her drawing-room,
as temporary sojourners at the National Capital
were often eager to meet the gracious woman who
had figured so conspicuously in the social history of the
country.</p>

<p>I knew Madison Cutts's daughter, Rose Adele Cutts, or
"Addie" Cutts, as she was invariably called, when she
first entered society. Her reputation for beauty is well
known. I always associate her with japonicas, which she
usually wore in her hair and of which her numerous bouquets
were chiefly composed. Her father frequently accompanied
her to balls, and in the wee small hours of the
night, as he became weary, I have often been amused at
his summons to depart&mdash;"Addie, <i>allons</i>." As quite a
young woman, Addie Cutts married Stephen A. Douglas,
the "Little Giant," whom Lincoln defeated in the memorable
presidential election of 1860. It is said that her ambition
to grace the White House had much to do with the
disruption of the Democratic party, as it was she who
urged Douglas onward; and everyone knows that the di<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>vision
of the Democratic vote between Stephen A. Douglas
and John C. Breckenridge resulted in the election of Lincoln.
Some years after Douglas's death, his widow married
General Robert Williams, U.S.A., by whom she had
a number of children, one of whom is the wife of Lieutenant
Commander John B. Patton, U.S.N.</p>

<p>Mrs. Madison Cutts's sister, Mrs. Robert Greenhow, was
a woman of attractive appearance and unusual ability.
Her husband was a Virginian by birth and a man of decided
literary tastes. When I first knew her she was a
widow, and but few romances can excel in interest one
period of her career. She was a social favorite and her
house was the rendezvous of the prominent Southern politicians
of the day. This, of course, was before the Civil
War, during a portion of which she made herself conspicuous
as a Southern spy. At the commencement of the
struggle her zeal for the Southern cause became so conspicuous
and offensive to the authorities in Washington
that she was arrested and imprisoned in her own house on
Sixteenth Street, near K Street. Later she was confined
in the "Old Capitol Prison." General Andrew Porter,
U.S.A., whose widow still resides in Washington and is
one of my cherished friends, was Provost Marshal of the
District of Columbia at this time, and as such Mrs. Greenhow
was in his charge during her imprisonment. This
duty was made so irksome to him that, upon one occasion,
he exclaimed in desperation that he preferred to resign
his position rather than to continue such an uncongenial
task. It has been stated that information conveyed by
her to the Confederates precipitated the Battle of Bull
Run, which was so disastrous to the Union Army. Her
conduct, even in prison, was so aggressive that the government
officials decided she was altogether too dangerous a
character to remain in Washington. They accordingly
sent her, accompanied by her young daughter Rose, within
the Southern lines, fearing that even behind prison bars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
her ingenuity might devise some method of communicating
with the enemy. From the South she went to London,
where she published, in 1863, a volume entitled, "My
Imprisonment and the First Years of Abolition Rule at
Washington," to which I have already referred. I have
heard that this book had quite a circulation in Great Britain,
but that an attempt was made to suppress it in the
United States. The last year of the war, Mrs. Greenhow
was returning to America with considerable money acquired
by the sale of her book, which she carried with her
in gold. She took passage upon a blockade-runner which,
after pursuit, succeeded in reaching the port of Wilmington,
North Carolina. She was descending from her ship
into a small boat to go on shore when she made a false
step and fell into the water. Her gold tied around her
neck held her down and she was drowned. Her remains
were recovered and brought to the town hall, where they
laid in state prior to an imposing funeral service. She
was regarded throughout the South as a martyr to its
cause.</p>

<p>Old Washingtonians who recall Mrs. Greenhow's eventful
career will associate with her, in a way, Mrs. Philip
Phillips, who was also active in the Southern cause, and
whose husband represented Alabama with much ability for
one term in Congress. He subsequently remained in Washington,
where he was known as a distinguished advocate
before the Supreme Court. Mrs. Phillips's enthusiastic
friendship for the South made serious trouble for herself
and family. The first year of the war, all of them were
sent across the Union lines, and went to New Orleans,
where General Benjamin F. Butler was in command. A
few days after her arrival she Was brought before him
charged with "making merry" over the passing funeral
of Captain George Coleman De Kay of New York, an officer
in the Union Army. When General Butler inquired
why she laughed, she replied: "Because I was in a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
humor." Unable longer to suppress his indignation, Butler
exclaimed: "If such women as you and Mrs. Greenhow
are let loose, our lives are in jeopardy." Mrs. Phillips's
reply was: "We of the South hire butchers to kill our
swine." Another day a search was made in Mrs. Phillips's
house for information concerning the Confederacy which
she was thought to have. When personally searched and
compelled to remove her shoes, she suggested that it was
impossible for a Northern man to get his hand inside a
Southern woman's shoe. General Butler finally ordered
Mrs. Phillips to be confined on an island near New Orleans,
and placed over her a guard whose duty it was to
watch her night and day. I have often heard her give an
account of her life under these trying circumstances. She
said she lived in a large "shoe box"&mdash;whatever that meant&mdash;and
that her meals were served to her three times a day
upon a tin plate. From what I have already said, it is
apparent that she was an exceedingly witty woman. One
day, while walking on the streets in Washington, she was
joined by a distinguished prelate of the Roman Catholic
Church, and inquired whether he could lay aside his cloth
long enough to listen to a conundrum? Upon receiving
a favorable response, she asked: "Why is His Holiness,
the Pope, like a goose?" The reply was: "Because he
sticks to his Propaganda!"</p>

<p>I shall always recall with pleasure a dinner party I attended
at the residence of Edward Everett. As Mrs.
Everett was in very delicate health and seldom appeared
in public, Mr. Everett presided alone. The invitations
were for six o'clock, and dinner was served promptly at
that hour. I was taken into the dining-room by Mr.
Philip Griffith, one of the Secretaries of the British Legation.
We had just finished our second course when, to
the surprise of everyone, a tall and gaunt gentleman was
ushered into the dining-room. It was Alexander H.
Stephens of Georgia, then a member of Congress and sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>sequently
Vice-President of the Southern Confederacy.
Mr. Everett at once arose and shook hands with Mr.
Stephens and with an imperturbable expression of countenance
motioned the butler to provide another seat at the
table. For a moment there was a slight confusion, as the
other guests were obliged to move in order to make room
for the new comer; but everything was speedily arranged
and Mr. Stephens began his dinner with the third course.
No explanation was offered at the moment, but later, while
we were drinking our coffee in the drawing-room, I noticed
Mr. Everett and Mr. Stephens engaged in conversation.</p>

<p>A few days later, through Mr. Colin M. Ingersoll, a
Representative in Congress from Connecticut, the cause
of Mr. Stephens' late appearance at the dinner was made
clear to me. It seems that Mr. Everett and the French
Minister, the Count Eug&egrave;ne de Sartiges, his next door
neighbor, were giving dinner parties the same evening.
The dinner hour at the French Legation was half-past
six o'clock, while Mr. Everett's was half an hour earlier.
Through the mistake of a stupid coachman, Mr. Stephens
was landed at the door of Count de Sartiges's home and
entered it under the impression that it was Mr. Everett's
residence. He walked into the drawing-room and suspected
nothing, as nearly all the guests were familiar to
him. Count de Sartiges, however, surprised at the presence
of an unbidden guest, anxiously inquired of Mr. Ingersoll
the name of the stranger, and upon being informed
remarked: "I'll be very polite to him." Seating himself
by Mr. Stephens' side, an animated conversation followed.
Meanwhile other guests arrived and the Count de Sartiges
became diverted, while Mr. Stephens, still unconscious of
his mistake, turned to Mr. Ingersoll, who stood near, and
in an irritated tone of voice said: "Who is this Frenchman
who is tormenting me, and where is Mr. Everett?" Mr.
Ingersoll explained that the Frenchman was the Count de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Sartiges, and that Mr. Everett was probably presiding
over his own dinner in the adjoining house.</p>

<p>My <i>vis &agrave; vis</i> at Mr. Everett's table was Miss Ann G.
Wight, a woman with an unusual history. She was born
in Montgomery County, Maryland, and as a child was
placed in a convent. She eventually became a nun and an
inmate of the Convent of the Visitation in Georgetown,
where she assumed the name of "Sister Gertrude." She
was an intellectual woman and was deeply beloved by her
associates. Without any apparent cause, however, she
planned an escape from the convent and sought the residence
of her relative, General John P. Van Ness, dropping
her keys, as I have understood, in Rock Creek as she
passed over the Georgetown bridge. Mrs. Charles Worthington,
a Catholic friend of mine who was educated at
this same convent, gave me the following explanation of
her conduct: There was an election for Mother Superior,
and Miss Wight, deeply disappointed that she was not
chosen to fill the position, was dissatisfied and when it
became her turn to answer the front-door bell, suddenly
determined to leave. She was, however, recognized by
one of the priests, who followed her to General Van Ness's
residence, where he insisted upon seeing her. At first she
refused to meet him, but, upon informing the General that
he must learn from her own lips whether her departure
was voluntary, she consented to see him in the presence of
her relative. She admitted that she had in no way been
influenced. When I first met Miss Wight she was more
devoted to "the pride, pomp and circumstance" of the
world than many who had not led such deeply religious
lives. She was still living at the residence of General Van
Ness, and I have heard that she always remained a Roman
Catholic. During the Everett dinner my escort, Mr. Philip
Griffith, remarked to me in an undertone: "We have
an escaped nun here; are we going to have an
<i>auto da f&eacute;</i>?" I responded that I believed it to be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
matter of record that <i>autos da f&eacute;</i> were solely a courtly
amusement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sidney Brooks, formerly Miss Fanny Dehon of
Boston, was another of Mr. Everett's guests. She was a
relative of our host, and it was her custom to make prolonged
visits to the Everett home. Her presence in Washington
was always hailed with delight. She was a pronounced
blonde, and her reputation as a brilliant conversationalist
was widely extended.</p>

<p>Rufus Choate was an occasional visitor in Washington
subsequent to his brilliant senatorial career which ended
in 1845. That I had the pleasure of intimately knowing
this man of wit and erudition is one of the brightest memories
of my life. His quaint humor was inexhaustible
and some of his bright utterances will never perish. When
a younger sister of mine was lying desperately ill in
Washington in 1856 he called to inquire about her condition,
and the tones of his sympathetic voice still linger in
my ear. It has been fittingly said of Mr. Choate that
even one's name uttered by him was in itself a delicate
compliment. It is to him we owe the inspiring quotation,
"Keep step to the music of the Union," which he
uttered in his speech before the Whig convention of 1855.
I have heard some of Mr. Choate's clients dwell upon his
mighty power as an advocate, and it seems to me that
words of law flowing from such lips might have been suggestive
of the harmony of the universe. The chirography
of Mr. Choate was equal to any Chinese puzzle; it was
even more difficult to decipher than that of Horace
Greeley. I once received a note from him and was obliged
to call upon my family to aid me in reading it. He had a
fund of humor which was universally applauded by an admiring
public. Once, in replying to a toast on Yale College
at the "Hasty-Pudding" dinner, he said that "everything
is to be irregular this evening." He followed this
remark by poking a little fun at the expense of the College<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
by reading a portion of the will of Lewis Morris, one of
the Signers and the father of Gouverneur Morris. This
document was executed in 1760 in New York, and in it he
expresses his "desire that my son, Gouverneur Morris, may
have the best education that is to be had in Europe or
America, but my express will and directions are that he be
never sent for that purpose to the Colony of Connecticutt,
lest he should imbibe in his youth that low craft and cunning
so incident to the People of that Colony, which is
so interwoven in their Constitutions that all their art cannot
disguise it from the World; though many of them,
under the sanctifyed garb of Religion, have endeavored
to impose themselves on the World for honest men." The
laughter which followed the reading of this extract was as
<i>regular</i> as the remarks were <i>irregular</i>. It may be added
that Lewis Morris died two years after making this will,
when his son Gouverneur was between ten and eleven
years of age, and that his desires were respected, as his
son was graduated from King's (now Columbia) College
in New York in 1768, when only sixteen years old. His
father, cold in the grave, had his revenge on the "Colony
of Connecticutt" and the hatchet, for aught we know to
the contrary, was forever buried, while old Elihu's college
still survives in New Haven.</p>

<p>An anecdote relating to Gouverneur Morris still lingers
in my memory. Before his marriage, quite late in life, to
Miss Anne Cary Randolph, his nephew, Gouverneur Wilkins,
was generally regarded as heir to his large estate.
When a direct heir was born, Mr. Wilkins was summoned
to the babe's christening. One of the guests began to
speculate upon the name of the youngster, when Mr. Wilkins
quickly said, "Why, <i>Cut-us-off-sky</i>, of course," in
imitation of the usual termination of such a large number
of Russian names.</p>

<p>In 1852 John F. T. Crampton was British Minister to
the United States and I had the pleasure of knowing him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
quite well. He was a bachelor of commanding presence,
and it was rather a surprise to Washingtonians that he
evaded matrimonial capture! He lived in Georgetown in
an old-time and spacious mansion, surrounded by ample
grounds. The proverbial tea-drinking period had not arrived,
but Mr. Crampton, notwithstanding this fact, gave
afternoon receptions for which his house, by the way, was
especially adapted. In 1856, during the Crimean War,
an unpleasantness arose between Great Britain and this
country in connection with the charge that Crampton had
been instrumental in recruiting soldiers in the United
States for service in the British Army. Accordingly, in
May of the same year, President Pierce broke off diplomatic
relations with him and he was recalled. There was
never, however, any severe reflection made upon him by
his home Ministry, and after his return to England he was
made a Knight of the Bath by Lord Palmerston, and a little
later became the British Minister at St. Petersburg.
In the autumn of 1856, while in Russia, he married Victoire
Balfe, second daughter of Michael William Balfe,
the distinguished musical composer, from whom he was
divorced in 1863.</p>

<p>I frequently attended receptions at the British Legation,
and I particularly recall those in the spring of the
year when they took the form of <i>f&ecirc;tes champ&ecirc;tres</i> upon
the well-kept lawn. On these occasions the Diplomatic
Corps was well represented, as well as the resident society.
I have heard a curious story about Henry Stephen
Fox, the English Minister in Washington from 1836 to
1844. He evidently represented the sporting element of
his day, as it was said he was <i>en &eacute;vidence</i> all night and
seldom visible by daylight. He was, moreover, exceedingly
careless about some of the reasonable responsibilities
of life which rendered it difficult for his creditors to secure
an audience. They, however, surrounded his house
in the First Ward one evening and demanded in clamor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>ous
tones that he should name a definite time when he
would satisfy their claims. Fox appeared at a front window
and pleasantly announced that, as they were so urgent
in their demands, he would state a time which he hoped
would meet with their satisfaction, and accordingly named
in stentorian voice the "Day of Judgment."</p>

<p>One of the constant visitors at our home on G Street
was John Savile-Lumley, who was appointed in 1854 as
the Secretary of the British Legation under Crampton,
and in the following year became the English <i>Charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>
in Washington. I remember him as a fine looking
gentleman and an especially pleasing specimen of the English
race. He was the natural son of John Lumley-Savile,
the eighth Earl of Scarborough, by a mother of
French origin. After leaving Washington, he represented
his country in Rome and other prominent courts of Europe,
and, upon his retirement from the diplomatic service
in 1888, was raised to the peerage as Baron Savile of Rufford
in Nottinghamshire. The last I heard of him was
through one of Lord Ronald Gower's charming books of
travel, where it states that he was representing Great
Britain at the court of Leopold I. in Belgium. He died
in the fall of 1896. His younger brother lived in London
where, for a period, he acted as a sort of major-domo in
society, and but few entertainments were considered complete
without him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>DIPLOMATIC CORPS AND OTHER CELEBRITIES</h3>


<p>I have already spoken of the Count de Sartiges, who
so ably represented the French Government in the
United States. He had not been very long in this
country when he married Miss Anna Thorndike of Boston,
and while residing in Washington they dispensed a
lavish hospitality. Just before he came to this country,
the Count spent several years in Persia, which was then
regarded as an out-of-the-way post of duty. I recall quite
an amusing incident which occurred at an entertainment
given by the Countess de Sartiges to which I was accompanied
by George Newell, brother-in-law of William L. Marcy.
Mr. Newell had not been in Washington long enough to,
become acquainted with all the members of the Diplomatic
Corps, and, crossing the room to where I stood, he inquired:
"Who is the Aborigine who has been sitting next
to me?" I looked in the direction indicated and recognized
the well-known person of General Juan Nepomuceno
Almonte, the Mexican Minister, whose features
strongly portrayed the Indian type. Some matrimonial
alliances in Mexico at this time, by the way, were more or
less complicated; for example, General Almonte's wife
was his own niece.</p>

<p>The first Secretary of the French Legation was Baron
Geoffrey Boilleau, who remained in this country for several
years. While stationed in Washington, he married
Susan Benton, a daughter of Thomas H. Benton, U.S.
Senator from Missouri and a political autocrat in his own
State, another of whose daughters, Jessie Ann, was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
wife of General John C. Fremont. At a later day, both
Boilleau and Fremont became involved in difficulties of a
serious character in consequence of which the former,
while Minister to Ecuador, was recalled to France, where,
as I am informed, he was convicted and confined for a
period in the <i>Conciergerie</i>. I am not fully acquainted
with the exact details of the charges upon which he was
tried, but they had their origin in the negotiation of certain
bonds of the proposed Memphis and El Paso Railroad.
In my opinion, however, no one who knew Baron
Boilleau well ever doubted his integrity. He was a man
of decidedly literary tastes and, like many persons of
that character, possessed but meager knowledge of business.
It seems that General Fremont had obtained from
the Legislature of Texas a grant of state lands in the interests
of the railroad just referred to, which was to be
a portion of a projected transcontinental line from Norfolk,
Virginia, to San Diego and San Francisco. It has
been stated that "the French agents employed to place
the land-grant bonds of this road on the market made
the false declaration that they were guaranteed by the
United States. In 1869 the Senate passed a bill giving
Fremont's road the right of way through the territories,
an attempt to defeat it by fixing on him the onus of the
misstatement in Paris having been unsuccessful. In 1873
he was prosecuted by the French government for fraud
in connection with this misstatement. He did not appear
in person, and was sentenced by default to fine and
imprisonment, no judgment being given on the merits of
the case."</p>

<p>Prince Louis de Bearn, Secretary of the French Legation,
was a gentleman of most pleasing personality. He
was a strikingly handsome bachelor at the time I knew
him and was much seen in the gay world. He was never
called "Prince" in those days, but "Count"; but in a
letter now before me, written in 1904 by his son, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
recently an attach&eacute; of the French Embassy in Washington,
he claims that both his father and grandfather were
Princes by right of birth. He also states that the title was
borne by his family before the Revolution of 1789. During
his official life in Washington, Prince de Bearn married
Miss Beatrice Winans, daughter of Ross Winans of Baltimore.
Chevalier John George Hulsemann, the Austrian
Minister, was a convivial old bachelor and was much esteemed
at the Capital for his genial qualities. He lived
on F Street, below Pennsylvania Avenue, and was stationed
in Washington for many years.</p>

<p>Chevalier Giuseppe Bertinatti, the Italian Minister, commenced
his diplomatic career in Washington as a bachelor.
He did not occupy a house of his own, but lodged
at the establishment of Mrs. Ulrich, which was the headquarters
of many foreigners. Fifty years ago and more,
the members of the Diplomatic Corps, with few exceptions,
lived either in modest residences or in boarding
houses, in striking contrast with many of the imposing
mansions now occupied by the official representatives of
foreign lands. His mission was a diplomatic success and
while at the capital he married Mrs. Eug&eacute;nie Bass, a handsome
widow from Mississippi, and soon departed upon another
mission, taking his American bride with him. Soon
after the announcement of his prospective marriage, Count
Bertinatti issued invitations to a large dinner given in
honor of his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. When the gala day arrived, Mrs.
Bass, though quite indisposed, was persuaded to be present
at the dinner, but, feeling decidedly ill, she retired from
the table and in a short time became much nauseated.
When this state of affairs was explained to General George
Douglas Ramsay, one of the guests of the evening, his
quick sally was, "a Bass relief!"</p>

<p>Baron Frederick Charles Joseph von Gerolt, whom I
knew very well and who represented King William of
Prussia, is still affectionately recalled by his few survivors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
who cling to early associations. His departure from
Washington with his family was more deeply regretted
than that of some other foreign residents whom I remember,
as they had made many friends and had lived in
Washington so long that they were regarded almost as
permanent residents. The Misses Bertha and Dorothea
von Gerolt were graceful dancers and were very popular.
Dorothea married into the Diplomatic Corps and accompanied
her husband to Greece. I have heard that Bertha
became deeply attached to the Chevalier A. P. C. Van
Karnabeek, secretary of the Netherlands Legation, but
that, owing to religious considerations, her parents frowned
upon the alliance. She accordingly determined to enter
upon a cloistered life and went to the Georgetown convent
where she became a nun, and was known until the day of
her death in 1890 as "Sister Angela." Baron von Gerolt
was an intellectual man and, prior to his career in the
United States, his name was much associated with Baron
Alexander von Humboldt; but as neither he nor Madame
von Gerolt were proficient English scholars when they
first arrived they naturally depended upon others for instruction.
I can vouch for the truth of the statement that
upon one occasion they were advised by members of his
own legation to greet those whom they met with the words,
"I'm damned glad to see you."</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Bergmans, Secretary of the Belgian Legation,
married Lily Macalister, a Philadelphia heiress, who, in
her widowhood, returned to this country and made Washington
her home. Madame Bergmans was a devotee to
society and was particularly fond of dancing. She was
a <i>petite blonde</i>, and, even after it ceased to be fashion,
she wore her light hair down her back in many ringlets.
When George M. Robeson, President Grant's Secretary
of the Navy, saw her for the first time one evening
while she was dancing, he exclaimed, "That is the tripping
of the light fantastic toe." She married quite late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in life J. Scott Laughton, who was considerably her junior,
but did not long survive the alliance.</p>

<p>Many members of the Diplomatic Corps of this period
married American women. Baron Guido von Grabow,
one of the secretaries of the Prussian Legation whom I
knew very well, married Mrs. Edward Boyce, whose
maiden name was Nina Wood. She was a granddaughter
of President Zachary Taylor and was well known and
beloved by old Washingtonians. Her marriage to Baron
von Grabow offers strong encouragement to persistent suitors.
He was deeply in love with her prior to her first
marriage, but she rejected him for Edward Boyce, who
was a member of a prominent Georgetown family. Mr.
Boyce lived only a few years, and her subsequent married
life with Baron von Grabow was long and happy.</p>

<p>Alexandre Gau, <i>Chancelier</i> of the Prussian Legation,
married my younger sister, Margaret, who was regarded
as a remarkable beauty as well as an accomplished linguist
and pianist. Her wedding took place in our G Street
home in the same room where five months later her funeral
services were held. Mr. Gau did not long survive her and
was interred by her side in my father's old burial plot in
Jamaica, Long Island.</p>

<p>Don Calderon de la Barca, the Spanish Minister to the
United States, together with his wife, who was Miss Fanny
Inglis, and her sister, Miss Lydia Inglis, were presiding
social spirits in Washington for many years. The latter
married a Mr. McLeod, and, becoming financially embarrassed,
established on Staten Island a school for girls
which was ably conducted. These sisters were members of
a Scotch family of distinguished lineage. One of Mrs.
McLeod's pupils was Mary E. Croghan, a prominent heiress
from Pittsburgh. She was still attending school on
Staten Island when Captain Edward W. H. Schenley of
the Royal Navy, a Scotch relative of Mrs. McLeod, came
to America to visit her. In inviting him to be her guest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
she felt that, as he was an elderly man, he would prove
to be quite immune to the attractions of mere school girls.
I met Captain Schenley about this same time in New York,
and his "make up" was of such a remarkable character
that it was a favorite <i>on dit</i> that, when he was dressed
for standing, a sitting posture was quite an impossibility.
Young Miss Croghan must have discovered fascinations in
this Scotchman as she eloped with him from Mrs. McLeod's
school and after a brief period accompanied him
to England, where she spent the remainder of her life.
Mrs. McLeod was severely criticised by her patrons for
carelessness, and her school was somewhat injured by Miss
Croghan's matrimonial adventure.</p>

<p>Don Leopoldo Augusto De Cueto was another Spanish
Minister, whom I regarded as an agreeable acquaintance.
During his <i>r&eacute;gime</i> filibustering against Spanish possessions,
and especially Cuba, was a favorite pastime of
American citizens and rendered the position of the Spanish
Minister in Washington one of delicacy and difficulty.
Residing in Washington during De Cueto's tenure
of office was a Cuban named Ambrosio Jos&eacute; Gonzales,
who, in the Civil War, became Inspector General of Artillery
in the Confederate Army, under General Beauregard.
As he was well versed in music and had a remarkable
voice, he frequently, upon request, sang selections
from the popular operas then in vogue. Among the songs
frequently heard in drawing-rooms was "Suoni la
Tromba," from Bellini's opera "I Puritani di Scozia,"
which had been interdicted by the Spanish Government.
One evening when De Cueto was spending an informal
evening with my sisters and myself at our G Street home,
Mr. Gonzales happened to call and was asked to sing.
He seated himself at the piano and for sometime sang
various airs for us. Finally, not knowing that "Suoni
la Tromba" was under the Spanish ban, I asked him to
sing it. During the song De Cueto was politely attentive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and at its conclusion had the politeness to applaud it.
Imagine, however, my surprise when I heard a few days
later, through a mutual friend, that Gonzales had
boasted that he sang the song in De Cueto's presence,
proudly adding that he had looked the Spaniard full in
the eye when he uttered the word <i>libert&#259;</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Jos&eacute; de Marcoleta, the Nicaraguan Minister to the
United States, was an elderly and punctilious Spaniard.
He was indefatigable in the observance of all social duties,
and I met him wherever I went. He was a bachelor but,
soon after his arrival in Washington, announced his engagement
to Miss Mary West of Boston, who unfortunately
died before her wedding day. I am under the
impression that he eventually married another American.
I remember once when he called to see us I asked him to
tell me something about Nicaragua, which was then an
almost unknown country. My surprise can hardly be described
when he told me he had never seen the country
which he represented, but was a native of Spain.</p>

<p>Baron Waldemar Rudolph Raasloff represented Denmark
in a manner creditable both to his country and our
own. He told me that some years previous to his mission
to America he came to New York in the capacity of an
engineer and was engaged on work in New York harbor,
"blowing up rocks." Possibly he was thus employed at
"Hell Gate," at that time one of the most dangerous obstacles
to navigation in that vicinity.</p>

<p>The well-known "Octagon," as the old Tayloe home on
the corner of New York Avenue and Eighteenth Street is
still called, during my early residence in Washington was
closed. Many superstitious persons regarded it with fear,
as its reputation as a haunted house was then, in their
opinion, well established. I have been told by the daughters
of General George D. Ramsay that upon one occasion
their father was requested by Colonel John Tayloe, the
father of Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, to remain at the Octagon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
over night, when he was obliged to be absent, as a protection
to his daughters, Anne and Virginia. While the
members of the family were at the evening meal, the bells
in the house began to ring violently. General Ramsay
immediately arose from the table to investigate, but failed
to unravel the mystery. The butler, in a state of great
alarm, rushed into the dining-room and declared that it
was the work of an unseen hand. As they continued to
ring, General Ramsay held the rope which controlled the
bells, but, it is said, they were not silenced. The architect
of the Octagon was Dr. William Thornton, of the
West Indies, who designed the plans of the first capitol
in Washington and who was the controlling spirit of the
three Commissioners appointed by Congress to acquire a
"territory not exceeding ten miles square" for the establishment
of a permanent seat of government. These men
were Daniel Carroll, Thomas Johnson, first Governor of
the State of Maryland, and David Stuart. Most of this
land, which included Georgetown and Alexandria, was
primeval forest and was owned chiefly by Daniel Carroll,
Notley Young, Samuel Davidson and David Burns.</p>

<p>The Commissioners had great difficulty in dealing with
Burns, who owned nearly all of what is now the northwestern
section of the city, as he was a closefisted and
hardheaded Scotchman, who was unwilling to part with
his lands without being roundly paid for them. When
argument with him proved fruitless, it is said that General
Washington, realizing the gravity of the situation,
rode up several times from Mount Vernon to discuss the
situation with "stubborn Mr. Burns." At length, in
despair, he remarked: "Had not the Federal City been
laid out here, you would have died a poor planter." "Ay,
mon," was Burns's ready response, "and had you no married
the widder Custis wi' a' her nagres ye'd ha'e been a
land surveyor the noo', an' a mighty poor ane at that!"
It is further related that Washington finally succeeded in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
winning Burns over to his way of thinking, and that the
canny Scotchman, realizing how largely he was to profit
by the transaction, actually became generous and gave to
the Commissioners, in fee simple, his apple orchard which
is now the beautiful Lafayette Square.</p>

<p>In passing through Lafayette Square, I have often sat
down upon a bench to rest near the "wishing tree," a
dwarf chestnut so well known to residents of the District,
and I have been impressed by the many superstitious persons,
both men and women, who have stopped for a moment
and silently stood under its branches. Many are
the credulous believers in its power to satisfy human desires,
and the season when its branches are full of nuts
is regarded by these as a specially propitious time for
their realization. With many persons this tree is the basis
of their only superstition.</p>

<p>I remember the case of a young girl who had been
working very hard to obtain a position in one of the departments
but without success and who, thoroughly discouraged,
came to the tree early one morning and made
the wish that to her and her family meant the actual necessities
of life. She then sat down to rest upon a near-by
bench before going home, and while there became engaged
in conversation with a pleasing looking woman, to
whom she poured forth her heart as she related her hopes
and disappointments about obtaining a government position.
As her listener was a sympathetic person, she asked
the young woman her name and address, and in a few
days the poor girl received a notice to go to a certain department
for examination. It seems that her companion
under the tree was the wife of an influential Senator,
who was so touched by the young woman's efforts, as
well as by her childish faith in the "wishing tree," that
she took pleasure in seeing that her great desire was gratified.</p>

<p>At this time Washington was not far behind other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
large cities in games of chance, and gambling was frequently
indulged in quite openly. Edward Pendleton's
resort, a luxurious establishment down town, was regarded
as quite <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, and I have heard it said that he had
able assistance from social ranks. I have often wondered
why a man who indulged in this sport was called a
gambler, as the term "gamester," used many years ago,
seems decidedly more appropriate. I own two volumes
of a very old book, published in the eighteenth century,
entitled "The Gamesters," in which the heroes are professional
gamblers. I have seen Mrs. Pendleton's costly
equipage, drawn by horses with brilliant trappings and
followed by blooded hounds, coursing the length of Pennsylvania
Avenue, while its owner seemed entirely unconscious
of the aching hearts which had contributed to all
her grandeur. Cards were universally played in private
homes and whist was the fashionable game, General Scott
being one of its chief devotees. I have often thought how
much the old General would have enjoyed "bridge," as
there was nothing that gave him more pleasure than playing
the "dummy hand."</p>

<p>My old friend, Mrs. Diana Bullitt Kearny, the widow
of General "Phil" Kearny, in our many chats in her latter
days, gave me many reminiscences of Washington at
a time when I was not residing there. She described a
fancy-dress ball given by her while residing in the old
Porter house on H Street, which must have been about
1848, as General Kearny had just returned from the Mexican
War. She dwelt particularly upon the costume of
Emma Meredith, one of her guests and the daughter of
Jonathan Meredith of Baltimore, who came to Washington
to attend the party. She represented a rainbow and her
appearance was so gorgeous that Mrs. Kearny said the
Heavenly vision seemed almost within the grasp of common
mortals. Miss Meredith's supremacy as a belle has
never been eclipsed. I recall a painful incident connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
with her life. A young naval officer was deeply in love
with her and, it is said, was under the impression that she
intended to marry him. At a theater party one evening
he discovered his mistake and, taking the affair to heart,
returned to his quarters and the same evening swallowed
a dose of corrosive sublimate. Physicians were immediately
summoned and, although he regretted the act and
expressed a desire to live, they were unable to save him.
It is said that about the same time Miss Meredith left her
home in Baltimore to visit her sister, Mrs. Gardiner G.
Howland, whose husband was one of the merchant princes
of New York, and that, as she crossed the Jersey City
Ferry, one of the first objects which met her eyes was the
funeral cortege of her disappointed lover <i>en route</i> to his
final resting place. Subsequent to this tragedy, I met Miss
Meredith in Saratoga, surrounded by the usual admiring
throng. She never married. I heard of her in recent
years, at a summer resort near Baltimore, and, although
advanced in years, I understood she still possessed exceptional
powers of attraction. Only a short time ago I
heard a young man remark that he knew her very well
and that he would rather converse with her than with
women many years her junior.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kearny was said to be the last of the "Lafayette
girls." In 1825, when Lafayette made his memorable
visit to the United States as the guest of the nation, she
was living with her parents in Louisville, and at the tender
age of five strewed flowers in the pathway of the distinguished
Frenchman. She remembered the incident
perfectly and in our numerous conversations I have repeatedly
heard her allude to it. She told me that, seated
at General Lafayette's side in the carriage which conveyed
him through the city, was the great-uncle, Colonel
Richard C. Anderson, who led the advance of the American
troops at the Battle of Trenton. General Robert Anderson,
U.S.A., whose memory the country honors as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
defender of Fort Sumpter, was his son. The General's
widow, a daughter of General Duncan L. Clinch, U.S.A.,
resided in Washington until her death a few years ago.
She was a woman of rare intelligence and, although a
great invalid for many years, gathered around her an
appreciative circle of friends, who were always charmed
by her attractive personality.</p>

<p>In my earliest recollection of Washington the old Van
Ness house was still sheltered by many trees. The foliage
was so dense that it may have been the desire of the
occupants to shield themselves in this manner from public
view. When I first knew the landmark it was occupied
by Thomas Green, an old-time resident of the District.
He married, as his second wife, Ann Corbin Lomax,
a daughter of Major Mann Page Lomax of the
Ordnance Department of the Army. During the Civil
War, Mr. Green's sympathies were with the South, but
he took no active part in the conflict. One of his idiosyncrasies
was to pick up, on and around his spacious grounds,
scraps of old iron, such as horse shoes, hay rakes and the
like, which were placed in a corner of his capacious cellar.
Suspicion was centered upon his house by information
given to the government by an old family servant
who thought he was doing the country a service, and directions
were accordingly given that it should be searched.
While this order was in process of execution, the discovery
of the scrap-iron is said to have played an important
part and in some unaccountable manner to have aroused
further suspicion. Whatever the logic of the situation
may have been is not intelligible, but the fact remains
I that Mr. and Mrs. Green and the latter's sister, Miss Virginia
Lomax, were arrested in a summary manner and
taken to the Old Capital Prison, where for a time they
were kept in close confinement, during which Miss Lomax
suffered severe indisposition and, as is said, never entirely
recovered from the effects of her incarceration. About<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
twenty-five years after the War, while staying at the same
house with her in Warrenton, Virginia, I quite longed to
hear her reminiscences of prison life; but when I expressed
my desire to a member of her family, I was requested
not to broach the subject as, even at this late day,
it was painful to her as a topic of conversation.</p>

<p>During the War of 1812, Major Lomax was sent upon a
mission to Canada by the U.S. Government and, one day
during his brief sojourn, dined in company with some
British officers. During the dinner a toast was offered
by one of the sons of John Bull: "To President Madison,
dead or alive." The responding toast by Major Lomax
was: "To the Prince Regent, drunk or sober." The British
officer who had proposed the toast to Madison immediately
sprang to his feet and with much indignation
inquired: "Do you mean to insult me, sir?" The quick
rejoinder was: "I am responding to an insult!"</p>

<p>I met Charles Sumner soon after his first appearance
in the United States Senate as the successor of Daniel
Webster, who had become Secretary of State. He was a
man of striking appearance and bore himself with the dignity
so characteristic of the statesmen of that period.
"Sumner is one of them literary fellows," was the facetious
criticism of the Hon. Zachariah Chandler of Michigan,
who a few years later became one of his colleagues in
the Senate, and who in earlier life was accumulating a
large fortune while Mr. Sumner, in his Massachusetts
home, was engaged in those intellectual and scholarly pursuits
which eventually made him one of the ripest and
most accomplished students in the land. Chandler, however,
in his own way, furnished a conspicuous example to
aspiring youths of the day, both by his earlier and subsequent
life, of what may be accomplished by determined
application.</p>

<p>For a decade or more preceding the Civil War the political
sentiment of Washington, especially in reference to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the violent anti-slavery agitation then engrossing the
thought of the country, was decidedly in sympathy with
the attitude of the South. It is not, therefore, surprising
that Sumner, whose radical views were known from
Maine to Texas, should have been received at first in
Washington society with but little cordiality. As the
years passed along, he was rapidly forging himself ahead
to the leadership of his party in the Senate and, of course,
became strongly inimical to Buchanan's administration.
He was regarded with confidence and esteem by his own
party, and, although naturally both disliked and feared by
his political opponents, it could be truthfully said of him
that he was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A man that fortune's buffets and rewards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast ta'en with equal thanks,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and that no attempts to socially ostracize or to deride
him for his political views and his intense application to
his sense of duty deterred the great Massachusetts statesman
from pursuing the "even tenor of his way."</p>

<p>An anecdote went the rounds of the Capital to the effect
that, one morning when a gentleman called to see
Sumner at his rooms on Pennsylvania Avenue, a colored
attendant answered the door and after glancing at his
card informed him that it would be impossible to disturb
his master, as he was rehearsing before a looking-glass a
speech which he expected to deliver the following morning.
Whether this was originally told by a friend or foe of Mr.
Sumner is not known. Mr. Sumner once requested me
to take him to see a young Washington belle who combined
Parisian grace with Kentucky dash. I refer to Miss Sally
Strother, an acknowledged beauty of decidedly Southern
views, who lived on Seventh Street near F Street, now a
commercial center. Mr. Sumner and I walked to her
house from my home on G Street and found several
guests in her drawing-room, where the topic of conversa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>tion,
in the course of the evening, drifted to the subject of
spiritualism. It was announced that at a recent <i>s&eacute;ance</i>
the spirit of Washington had appeared and uttered the
usual platitudes, whereupon Miss Strother, without a moment's
hesitation, remarked: "I wonder what General
Washington would say about Mr. Sumner?" Someone
undertook to define Washington's views, but Miss Strother
interrupted and said: "I know just what he would say&mdash;that
he was a very intelligent, a very handsome, but a
very bad man." This remark was naturally productive
of much mirth, but failed to arouse any manifestation of
feeling or disapprobation on the part of Mr. Sumner.
Later, as we were walking homeward he remarked: "I
have <i>l'esprit d'escalier</i> and my retorts do not come until
I am well-nigh down the flight of stairs." Sally Strother
went abroad, where she married Baron Fahnenberg of
Belgium, and shared a fate similar to that of many of her
country-women, as she was finally separated from her husband.
She cherished, however, a pride of title and bequeathed
$60,000 to erect in Spa, Belgium, a handsome
chapel as well as a vault to contain the remains of her
mother, brother and herself. Her Kentucky relatives, however,
including the family of Mrs. Basil Duke, succeeded in
breaking the will on the ground that her mother's will,
through which she had inherited her property, did not
permit it to leave the family. The chapel and vault, accordingly,
were not built, and all her property reverted to
her relatives.</p>

<p>In addition to his commanding presence, nature bestowed
upon Mr. Sumner a clear and melodious voice, which rendered
it quite unnecessary for him to resort to Demosthenic
methods of cultivation. For many years his inspiring
words could be heard upon the floor of the Senate
in all of the leading debates of the day, and his masterly
orations will go down to posterity as an important contribution
to the history of many national administrations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>I well remember Preston S. Brooks's cowardly assault
upon Charles Sumner in the Senate Chamber in the spring
of 1856. Public indignation ran very high, and his political
opponents referred to him thereafter as "Bully Brooks."
Socially, as well as politically, he was popular. He possessed
a gentle and pleasing bearing and it would have
been difficult for anyone to associate him with such a cruel
outrage. His uncle, Andrew P. Butler, who was in the
U.S. Senate from South Carolina at the same time, was
a fine-looking and venerable gentleman, but he was one of
the class then designated as "fire-eaters."</p>

<p>There existed between Mr. Sumner and Henry W.
Longfellow a strong friendship which was contracted in
early life. I have often heard the Massachusetts statesman
recite some of his friend's poetical lines, which
seemed to me additionally beautiful when rendered in
his deep and sonorous voice. In the latter years of his
life he resided in the house which is now the Arlington
Hotel Annex, where he surrounded himself with his remarkable
collection of books and articles of <i>virtu</i> which
he exhibited with pride to his guests. I especially recall
an old clock presented to him by Henry Sanford, Minister
to Belgium, as an artistic work of exceptional beauty.
Mr. Sumner, by the way, was an accomplished connoisseur
in art. I have heard him strongly denounce Clark
Mills's equestrian statue of General Andrew Jackson, now
standing in the center of Lafayette Square. He told me
that on one occasion he was conducting a party of Englishmen
through the streets of the National Capital and,
as they were driving along Pennsylvania Avenue, he
seated himself in such a position as to entirely obstruct
the view of what he called this "grotesque statue," calling
the attention of his guests, meanwhile, to the White
House on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>I felt honored in calling Charles Sumner my friend,
and I take especial pleasure in repeating the encomium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
that "to the wisdom of the statesman and the learning
of the scholar he joined the consecration of a patriot, the
honor of a knight and the sincerity of a Christian."
George Sumner, his brother, did not appear in the land
of his birth as a celebrity, but he had a remarkable career
abroad. He hobnobbed with royalty throughout the European
continent and was highly regarded for his profound
learning. He studied at the Universities of Heidelberg
and Berlin and traveled extensively through Europe,
Asia and Africa. He never tarried long in his "native
heath," and furnished conspicuous evidence that "a
prophet is not without honor save in his own country."
Alexander von Humboldt praised the accuracy of his researches
and Alexis de Tocqueville referred to him as being
better acquainted with European politics than any
European with whom he was acquainted.</p>

<p>While Sumner was in the Senate, George T. Davis of
Greenfield, Massachusetts, was a member of the House of
Representatives. I knew him very well and he was a
constant visitor at our home. He was celebrated for his
flashes of wit, which sometimes stimulated undeveloped
powers in others, and I have often seen dull perceptions
considerably sharpened at his approach. Oliver Wendell
Holmes speaks of his witty sayings in the "Autocrat of
the Breakfast Table," and his conversational powers were
so brilliant that they won the admiration of Thackeray.
Robert Rantoul, also from Massachusetts, and a colleague
of Davis, was a "Webster Whig" and a powerful exponent
of the "Free-Soil" faith. Davis, who was so
bright and clever in the drawing-room, could not, however,
compete with Rantoul on the floor of the House in
parliamentary debate. The epitaph on Rantoul's monument
says that "He died at his post in Congress, and his
last words were a protest in the name of Democracy
against the Fugitive-Slave Law." One of the verses of
Whittier's poem, entitled "Rantoul," reads as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>I first met the eccentric Count Adam Gurowski at the
convivial tea table of Miss Emily Harper in Newport,
upon one of those balmy summer evenings so indelibly
impressed upon my memory. He was, perhaps, in many
respects, one of the most remarkable characters that Washington
has ever known. He was a son of Count Ladislas
Gurowski, an ardent admirer of Kosciusko, and was active
in revolutionary projects in Poland in consequence of
which he was condemned to death by the Russian authorities.
He managed, however, to escape and in 1835 published
a work entitled "La Verit&eacute; sur la Russie," in which
he advocated a union of the various branches of the
Slavic race. This book was so favorably regarded in
Russia that its author was recalled and employed in the
civil service. He came to this country in 1849, and, after
being employed on the staff of <i>The New York Tribune</i>,
came to Washington, where his linguistic attainments and
the aid of Charles Sumner secured for him a position as
translator in the State Department, which he held from
1861 to 1863.</p>

<p>The Count was a medley of strange whims and idiosyncrasies
that almost baffle description. Together with his
strong individuality, he possessed a trait which made
many enemies and ultimately proved his undoing. I refer
to his uncontrollable desire to contradict and to antagonize.
It was simply impossible to find a subject upon
which he and anyone else could agree. There were, however,
extenuating circumstances. "Chill penury," forced
upon him by the state of his financial affairs, had much to
do with his cynical and acrimonious spirit. Prosperity
is certainly conducive to an amiable bearing, and I believe
that Gurowski would have been more conciliatory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
if adversity had not so persistently attended his pathway.
It is highly probable, too, that Gurowski would have retained
his position under the government indefinitely but
for his unfortunate disposition. He wrote a diary from
1861 to 1863 which he was so indiscreet as to keep in his
desk in the State Department; and, unknown at first to
him, some of its pages were brought to the attention of
certain officials of the government. They contained anything
but complimentary references to his chief, William
H. Seward, Secretary of State, and he was discharged.
Meanwhile he had antagonized his benefactor, Mr. Sumner,
by opposing, in a caustic manner, his views in reference
to the conduct of the Civil War, and by other similar
indiscretions was making new enemies almost every
day.</p>

<p>The intense bitterness and intemperance of Gurowski
in the expression of his views is well illustrated in a conversation
quoted by one of his friends in <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i> more than forty years ago. It had reference to
a period preceding the Civil War when the "Fugitive-Slave
Law" was engrossing the attention of the country.
"What do I care for Mr. Webster," he said. "I can read
the Constitution as well as Mr. Webster." "But surely,
Count, you would not presume to dispute Mr. Webster's
opinion on a question of constitutional law?" "And why
not? I tell you I can read the Constitution as well as
Mr. Webster, and I say that the 'Fugitive-Slave Law' is
unconstitutional&mdash;is an outrage, and an imposition of
which you will all soon be ashamed. It is a disgrace to
your humanity and to your republicanism, and Mr.
Webster should be hung for advocating it. He
is a humbug or an ass&mdash;an ass, if he believes such
an infamous law to be constitutional, and if he
does not believe it, he is a humbug and a scoundrel for
advocating it."</p>

<p>The Count's sarcastic reference to Secretary Seward is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
equally amusing. It seems that one of his duties, while
in the State Department, was to keep a close watch upon
the European newspapers for matters of interest to our
government, and also to furnish the Secretary of State,
when requested, with opinions on diplomatic questions,
or, as Gurowski expressed it, "to read the German newspapers
and keep Seward from making a fool of himself."
The first duty, he said, was easy enough, but the latter
was rather difficult!</p>

<p>In 1854 Gurowski published his book, "Russia as it is,"
which was soon followed by another work entitled, "America
and Europe." Both of them met with a favorable
reception, but, after losing his government position, it became
a difficult matter for him to eke out a maintenance,
and his disposition, if possible, became still more embittered.
At an evening party I took part by chance in an
animated discussion upon the subject of dueling. Suddenly
my eye lighted upon Count Gurowski, who had just
entered the room. Calling him to my side I asked him
in facetious tones how many men he had killed. He
quickly responded, "Wonly (only) two!"</p>

<p>Count Gurowski's fund of knowledge was in many ways
highly remarkable, especially upon his favorite theme of
royalty and nobility, past and present. He was intensely
disliked by the Diplomatic Corps in Washington, many
of whose members regarded him as a Russian spy, a suspicion
which, of course, was without the slightest foundation.
Baron Waldemar Rudolph Raasloff, the Danish
Minister, once refused to enter a box at the opera where
I was seated because Gurowski was one of the party.
The Count seemed to be in touch with sources of information
relating to diplomats and their affairs which were
unknown to others&mdash;a fact which naturally aroused dislike
and jealousy. He once announced to me, for example,
that the <i>attach&eacute;s</i> of the French Legation were in a
state of great good humor, as their salaries had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
raised that day. I once heard a member of a foreign legation
say to another: "Gurowski is an emanation of the
Devil." "The Devil, you say," was the response, "why,
he is the Devil himself." In discussing with a foreigner
the Count's exile by the Russian government, I said that
I knew of relatives of his in high position in Russia.
Evidently controlled by his prejudices, he replied: "It
must be a family of contrasts, as his position in this country
is certainly a low one." If he intended to convey the
impression that the Count was "low" in his pocket, his
statement was certainly correct, but not otherwise. It is
true that his unhappy disposition made him more enemies
than friends, but he was by no means devoid of admirable
traits, even if he so frequently preferred to conceal them.
The finer side of his nature and his pleasing qualities
only were presented to my sister, Mrs. Eames, who always
welcomed him to her house. One day when he
called the condition of his health seemed so precarious
that she insisted upon his becoming her guest. He accepted
the invitation, but did not long survive, and in the
spring of 1866 his turbulent spirit passed away while
under my sister's roof. Much respect was paid to his
memory and the most distinguished men and women in
Washington attended his funeral. He is buried in the
Congressional Cemetery, where a crested tablet surmounts
his grave. Little was generally known of his immediate
family relations, but Robert Carter, one of his most intimate
friends and the author of the article in <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i>, already referred to, states that he was a
widower and had a son in the Russian Navy and a married
daughter in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Early in life his brother, Count Ignatius Gurowski,
met the Infanta Isabella de Bourbon, sister of the Prince
Consort of Spain, while she was receiving her education
at the <i>Sacre Coeur</i> in Paris, and eloped with her. They
were pensioned by the Spanish government for a while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
under Queen Isabella's reign and made their home in
Brussels. I have heard, however, that when Isabella was
forced from the throne the pension ceased and their circumstances
became quite reduced. It is said that the
Prince Consort, Ignatius Gurowski's brother-in-law, suggested
to him soon after his marriage that it might be
well for him to be created a Duke of the realm. This
friendly offer was declined with indignation. "I would
prefer," said Gurowski, "being an old Count to a new
Duke!"</p>

<p>Sometime ago I saw the statement in a newspaper to
the effect that descendants of Ignatius Gurowski were
living in the United States. This suggests, although remotely,
the inquiry heard many years ago: "Have we a
Bourbon among us?"&mdash;referring, of course, to the last
Dauphin, whom many believed to exist in the person of
the Rev. Eleazer Williams, who resided in St. Lawrence
County, New York. The Rev. Dr. Francis L. Hawks
had such an abiding faith that Williams was actually
the Dauphin that he wrote an article in 1853 for
<i>Putnam's Magazine</i> expressive of his views. If the newspaper
story and Dr. Hawks's claims be true, this country
has accordingly been the retreat of more than one member
of the ill-fated Bourbon family. Several years ago I was
surprised to hear it stated that the father of Kuroki, the
famous Japanese General, was a brother of Adam and Ignatius
Gurowski. This information, I am informed, came
from a nephew of General Kuroki who was receiving his
education in Europe. "My uncle Kuroki," he is said to
have written, "is of Polish origin. His father was a
Polish nobleman by the name of Kourowski, who fled
from Russia after the Revolution of 1831. He finally
went to Japan and married a Japanese. As the name
of Kourowski is difficult to pronounce in Japanese, my
uncle pronounced it Kuroki. The General's father, upon
his death bed said to him that perhaps some day he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
be able to take vengeance upon the Russians for their
cruel treatment of unhappy Poland."</p>

<p>One of the most notable men of my acquaintance in
Washington was Caleb Cushing. I first met him when
he was Attorney-General in President Pierce's Cabinet,
and the friendship formed at that time lasted for many
years. He was among the guests at my wedding, and
Miss Emily Harper, whom he accompanied, told me that
he especially commented upon that portion of the service
which reads, "those whom God hath joined together, let
no man put asunder." His remarks evidently appealed
to her as an ardent Roman Catholic. Ralph Waldo Emerson
declared Mr. Cushing to be the most eminent scholar
of the country, and Wendell Phillips went still further
and said: "I regard Mr. Cushing as the most learned man
living." His habit was one of constant acquirement.
He was what I should call "a Northern man with Southern
principles," an expression which originated in 1835,
and was first applied to Martin Van Buren. I have
heard Cushing defend slavery with great eloquence and
although, like him, I was born and bred in the North, I
regarded that institution, in some respects, as far less iniquitous
than the infamous opium trade which so enriched
British and American merchants, and of which I saw so
much during my life in China.</p>

<p>It must have been from his Pilgrim forefather that Mr.
Cushing inherited a decided antipathy for Great Britain,
and it was once said that he carried this prejudice so far
that he refused to visit England. This statement, however,
is untrue, as I have before me an amusing article,
written many years ago by his private secretary, during
his mission to Spain, which contradicts it. He gives
some amusing incidents connected with his visit of a few
days in London when he and Mr. Cushing were <i>en route</i>
to Spain. "Mr. Cushing's headwear," he writes, "was a
silk hat which must have been the fashion of about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
time he discarded umbrellas. It was slightly pointed at
the top and there was, so to say, no back or front to it
and there was no band for it. As I knew he intended
paying several visits, I asked him if he would not exchange
his hat, which at the time was thoroughly soaked,
for a new and lighter one. The old man took off his ancient
hat, examined it critically and then said slowly and
deliberately, as if delivering an opinion on the bench,
'No, sir, I think that I shall wait and see what the fashions
are in Madrid.' It was said with much earnestness,
as if it had been a state question. A third person would
have found it irresistibly funny, but there was nothing
laughable in it to General Cushing. In fact, his sense of
humor was of a very grim order." He also writes:
"The old man was an inveterate smoker, and yet, during
the whole period of my intercourse with him, I did not see
him light a score of fresh cigars. He bought them, that
is certain, but he must have been averse to lighting them
in public for he almost invariably had a stump between
his lips. Ask him if he would have a cigar and the answer
would be, 'Thank you, sir, I think I have one,' and
out would come a dilapidated case, from which he
would shake from one to half a dozen butts as the
supply ran."</p>

<p>While Cushing was Attorney-General under President
Pierce, he formed a friendship with Madame Calderon
de la Barca, of whom I have already spoken, who, upon
his arrival in Madrid, was one of the first persons to greet
him. She was then a widow and occupied a high social
position at the Spanish court. Cushing and she thoroughly
enjoyed the renewal of their earlier friendship in
Washington, and the last visit he made in Madrid was
when he bade her a final farewell. In 1843, and prior to
his mission to Spain, Mr. Cushing was appointed by President
Tyler Minister to China, where his able diplomacy
has been the subject of recognition and admiration to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
day. He carried with him the following remarkable letter
which he was charged by the President to deliver in
person to the Emperor. It may have been&mdash;who knows?&mdash;the
first lesson in occidental geography submitted to the
"Brother of the Sun and the Sister of the Moon and
Stars." Had the President of the United States been
called upon to address a country Sunday School, he could
hardly have exhibited a more conscious effort to adapt
himself to the level of his hearers. This is the letter:&mdash;</p>

Illinois, Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas and Michigan&mdash;send
this letter of peace and friendship, signed by my
own hand.</p>

<p>I hope your health is good. China is a great empire,
extending over a great part of the world. The Chinese
are numerous. You have millions and millions of subjects.
The twenty-six United States are as large as China,
though our people are not so numerous. The rising sun
looks upon the great mountains and great rivers of China.
When he sets he looks upon mountains and rivers equally
large in the United States. Our territories extend from
one great ocean to the other; and on the west we are divided
only from your domain by the sea. Leaving the
mouth of one of our great rivers and going constantly
towards the setting sun we sail to Japan and the Yellow
Sea.</p>

<p>Now, my words are that the governments of two such
great countries should be at peace. It is proper and according
to the will of heaven that they should respect each
other and act wisely. I therefore send to your Court
Caleb Cushing one of the wise and learned men of this
country. On his first arrival in China he will inquire for
your health. He has strict orders to go to your great city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of Pekin and there to deliver this letter. He will have
with him secretaries and interpreters.</p>

<p>The Chinese love to trade with our people and sell them
tea and silk for which our people pay silver and sometimes
other articles. But if the Chinese and Americans
will trade there should be rules so that they shall not
break your laws or our laws. Our minister, Caleb Cushing,
is authorized to make a treaty to regulate trade. Let
it be just. Let there be no unfair advantage on either
side. Let the people trade not only at Canton, but also
at Amoy, Ningpo, Shanghai, Fushan and all such other
places as may offer profitable exchanges both to China and
the United States, provided they do not break your laws
or our laws. We shall not take the part of the evil doers.
We shall not uphold them that break your laws. Therefore
we doubt that you will be pleased that our messenger
of peace, with this letter in hand, shall come to Pekin and
there deliver it, and that your great officers will, by your
order, make a treaty with him to regulate the affairs of
trade, so that nothing may happen to disturb the peace
between China and America. Let the treaty be signed by
your own imperial hand. It shall be signed by mine, by
the authority of the great council, the Senate.</p>

<p>And so may your health be good and may peace reign.</p>

<p>Written at Washington this twelfth day of July, in the
year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-three.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Your good friend,</p>

<p class='indent4'>
<span class="smcap">John Tyler</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Cushing accordingly negotiated our first treaty
with China on the 3d of July of the following year, and
his ability at that time, as well as thereafter, won for him,
irrespective of party affiliations, an enviable place in the
history of American diplomacy. He was sent upon his
mission to Spain in 1874 by the party which he had opposed
from its first organization, and his diplomatic erudition
was indispensable to the State Department during
the Grant administration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Certain events in the career of Mr. Cushing serve to
recall the days of Mr. and Mrs. Franklin Pierce, whose
lives were clouded by a grief that saddened the whole of
their subsequent career. A short time before Pierce's inauguration,
the President-elect with Mrs. Pierce and their
only son, a lad of immature years, were on their way to
Andover in Massachusetts, when the child was accidentally
killed. Mrs. Pierce never could be diverted from her
all-absorbing sorrow, and I shall always remember the
grief-stricken expression of this first Lady of the Land.
Her maiden name was Jane Means Appleton, and she was
the daughter of the Rev. Dr. Jesse Appleton, President of
Bowdoin College. During the Pierce administration,
Judge John Cadwalader, the father of the present John
Cadwalader of Philadelphia, was a member of Congress.
The son was then a mere lad, but he bore such a strong
resemblance to the President's son that one day when Mrs.
Pierce met him she was completely overcome. After this
boy had become a man and had attained exceptional
eminence at the bar, he feelingly alluded to this touching
incident of his earlier days.</p>

<p>I was very intimately acquainted with Elizabeth and
Fanny MacNeil, President Pierce's nieces, who were occasional
visitors at the White House. They were daughters
of General John MacNeil, U.S.A., who had acquitted himself
with distinction in the War of 1812. Elizabeth married,
as before stated, General Henry W. Benham of the
Engineer Corps of the Army, and Fanny became the wife
of Colonel Chandler E. Potter, U.S.A. Dr. Thomas
Miller was our family physician for many years. He came
to Washington from Loudoun County, Virginia, and married
Miss Virginia Collins Jones, daughter of Walter
Jones, an eminent lawyer. During the Pierce administration
he was physician to the President's family.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>MARRIAGE AND CONTINUED LIFE IN WASHINGTON</h3>


<p>I met my future father-in-law, Samuel L. Gouverneur,
Sr., for the first time in Cold Spring, New York.
Mr. Gouverneur, accompanied by his second wife,
then a bride, who was Miss Mary Digges Lee, of Needwood,
Frederick County, Maryland, and a granddaughter
of Thomas Sim Lee, second Governor of the same state,
was the guest of Gouverneur Kemble. When I first knew
Mr. Gouverneur he possessed every gift that fortune as
well as nature can bestow. To quote the words of Eliab
Kingman, a lifelong friend of his and who for many years
was the Nestor of the Washington press, "he even possessed
a seductive voice." General Scott, prior to my
marriage into the family, remarked to me that there "was
something in Mr. Gouverneur lacking of greatness."</p>

<p>The history of my husband's family is so well known
that it seems almost superfluous to dwell upon it, but, as
these reminiscences are purely personal, I may at least
incidentally refer to it. Samuel L. Gouverneur, Sr., was
the youngest child of Nicholas Gouverneur and his wife,
Hester Kortright, a daughter of Lawrence Kortright, a
prominent merchant of New York and at one time president
of its Chamber of Commerce. He was graduated
from Columbia College in New York in the class of 1817,
and married his first cousin, Maria Hester Monroe, the
younger daughter of James Monroe. This wedding took
place in the East Room of the White House. My husband,
Samuel L. Gouverneur, Jr., was the youngest child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of this alliance. <i>The National Intelligencer</i> of March 11,
1820, contained the following brief marriage notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><i>Married</i></p>

<p>On Thursday evening last [March 9th], in this City, by
the Reverend Mr. [William] Hawley, Samuel Laurence
Gouverneur, Esq., of New York, to Miss Maria Hester
Monroe, youngest daughter of James Monroe, President of
the United States.</p></div>

<p>For a number of years Samuel L. Gouverneur, Sr., was
private secretary to his father-in-law, President Monroe.
In 1825 he was a member of the New York Legislature,
and from 1828 to 1836 Postmaster of the City of New
York. For many years, like the gentlemen of his day and
class, he was much interested in racehorses and at one time
owned the famous horse, <i>Post Boy</i>. He was also deeply
interested in the drama and it was partially through his
efforts that many brilliant stars were brought to this country
to perform at the Bowery Theater in New York, of
which he was a partial owner. Among its other owners
were Prosper M. Wetmore, the well-known author and regent
of the University of the State of New York, and
General James A. Hamilton, son of Alexander Hamilton
and acting Secretary of State in 1829, under Jackson.
Mr. Gouverneur was a man of decidedly social tastes and
at one period of his life owned and occupied the De Menou
buildings on H Street in Washington, where, during the
life of his first wife, he gave some brilliant entertainments.
It was from this house that his son, and my future husband,
went to the Mexican War. Many years subsequent to my
marriage I heard Rear Admiral John J. Almy, U.S.N.,
describe some of the entertainments given by the Gouverneur
family, and he usually wound up his reminiscences
by informing me that sixteen baskets of champagne
were frequently consumed by the guests during a single
evening. My old friend, Emily Mason, loved to refer to
these parties and told me that she made her <i>d&eacute;but</i> at one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of them. The house was well adapted for entertainments,
as there were four spacious drawing-rooms, two on each
side of a long hall, one side being reserved for dancing.</p>

<p>At the time of the Gouverneur-Monroe wedding the
bride was but sixteen years of age, and many years younger
than her only sister, Eliza, who was the wife of Judge
George Hay of Virginia, the United States District-Attorney
of that State, and the prosecuting officer at the trial
of Aaron Burr. Mrs. Hay was educated in Paris at
Madame Campan's celebrated school, where she was the
associate and friend of Hortense de Beauharnais, subsequently
the Queen of Holland and the mother of Napoleon
III. The Rev. Dr. William Hawley, who performed
the marriage ceremony of Miss Monroe and Mr. Gouverneur,
was the rector of old St. John's Church in Washington.
He was a gentleman of the old school and always
wore knee breeches and shoe buckles. In the War of 1812
he commanded a company of divinity students in New
York, enlisted for the protection of the city. It is said
that when ordered to the frontier he refused to go and
resigned his commission, and I have heard that Commodore
Stephen Decatur refused to attend St. John's Church
during his rectorship, because he said he did not care to
listen to a man who refused to obey orders.</p>

<span class="caption">Mrs. James Monroe, n&eacute;e Kortright, by Benjamin West.<br /></span>
<span class='caption2'><i>Original portrait owned by Mrs. Gouverneur.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Only the relatives and personal friends attended the
Gouverneur-Monroe wedding at the White House; even
the members of the Cabinet were not invited. The gallant
General Thomas S. Jesup, one of the heroes of the
War of 1812 and Subsistance Commissary General of the
Army, acted as groomsman to Mr. Gouverneur. Two of
his daughters, Mrs. James Blair and Mrs. Augustus S.
Nicholson, still reside at the National Capital and are
prominent "old Washingtonians." After this quiet wedding,
Mr. and Mrs. Gouverneur left Washington upon a bridal
tour and about a week later returned to the White
House, where, at a reception, Mrs. Monroe gave up her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
place as hostess to mingle with her guests, while Mrs. Gouverneur
received in her place. Commodore and Mrs. Stephen
Decatur, who lived on Lafayette Square, gave the
bride her first ball, and two mornings later, on the twenty-second
of March, 1820, Decatur fought his fatal duel with
Commodore James Barron and was brought home a corpse.
"The bridal festivities," wrote Mrs. William Winston
Seaton, wife of the editor of <i>The National Intelligencer</i>,
"have received a check which will prevent any further
attentions to the President's family, in the murder of
Decatur." The invitations already sent out for an entertainment
in honor of the bride and groom by Commodore
David Porter, father of the late Admiral David D. Porter,
U.S.N., were immediately countermanded.</p>

<p>I never had the pleasure of knowing my mother-in-law,
Mrs. Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur, as she died some
years before my marriage, but I learned to revere her
through her son, whose tender regard for her was one of
the absorbing affections of his life and changed the whole
direction of his career. At an early age he was appointed
a Lieutenant in the regular Army and served with distinction
through the Mexican War in the Fourth Artillery.
On one occasion subsequent to that conflict, while his
mother was suffering from a protracted illness, he applied
to the War Department for leave of absence in order that
he might visit her sick bed; and when it was not granted
he resigned his commission and thus sacrificed an enviable
position to his sense of filial duty. Many years later,
after my husband's decease, in looking over his papers
I found these lines written by him just after his mother's
death:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A man through life has but <i>one</i> true friend and that
friend generally leaves him early. Man enters the lists
of life but ere he has fought his way far that friend falls
by his side; he never finds another so fond, so true, so
faithful to the last&mdash;<i>His Mother</i>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gouverneur was somewhat literary in her tastes
and, like many others of her time, regarded it as an accomplishment
to express herself in verse on sentimental
occasions. One of my daughters, whom she never saw,
owns the original manuscript of the following lines written
as a tribute of friendship to the daughter of President
John Tyler, at the time of her marriage:&mdash;</p>


<p class='center'>TO MISS TYLER ON HER WEDDING DAY.</p>

</div></div>

<p>After meeting Mr. and Mrs. Gouverneur, my future
husband's father and his second wife, at Cold Spring, I
renewed my acquaintance with them in Washington,
where they were living in an old-fashioned house on New
York Avenue, between Fourteenth and Fifteenth Streets.
We often welcomed Mrs. Gouverneur as a guest at our
Washington home and I was subsequently invited to visit
her at their country seat, Needwood, Frederick County,
Maryland, located upon a tract of land chiefly composed
of large farms at one time owned exclusively by the Lee
family. I quote Mrs. Gouverneur's graceful letter of invitation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My dear Miss Campbell,</p>

<p>I can not refrain from writing to remind you of your
promise to us; this must be about the time fixed upon, (at
least we all feel as if it was), and the season is so delightful,
not to mention the strawberries which will be in great
perfection this week&mdash;these reasons, together with our
great desire to see you, determined me to give you warning
that we are surely expecting you, and hope to hear
very soon from you to say when we may send to the <i>Knoxville</i>
depot for you. I would be so much gratified if Mrs.
Eames would come with you; it would give us all the sincerest
pleasure, and I do not think that such a journey
would be injurious. You leave Washington to come here
on the early (6 o'clock) train, get out at the Relay House,
and wait until the western cars pass, (about 8 o'clock),
get into them, and reach Knoxville at 12 o'clock. So you
see that altogether you have only six hours, and you rest
more than half an hour at the Relay House. From Knoxville
our carriage brings you to "Needwood" in less than
an hour. If there is any gentleman you would like to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
come as an escort Mr. G. and myself will be most happy
to see him. Dr. Jones, you know, does intend to travel
about a little and said he would come to see us; perhaps
he will come with you, or Mr. Hibbard I should be most
happy to see&mdash;anyone in short whom you choose to bring
will be most welcome. Tell Mr. Hibbard I read his speech
and admired it as I presume everyone does. Good-bye,
dear Miss Campbell. I hope you will aid me in persuading
Mrs. Eames to come with you. My warmest regards
to Mrs. Campbell and your sisters, in which my sister
[Mrs. Eugene H. Lynch] and Mr. Gouverneur unite.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Believe me, yours most truly,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">M. D. Gouverneur</span>.</p>

<p>Needwood, May 22nd, 1854.</p></div>

<p>I accepted the invitation and, while I was Mrs. Gouverneur's
guest, my sister Margaret was visiting one of the
adjoining places at the home of Colonel John Lee, whose
wife's maiden name was Harriet Carroll. She was a
granddaughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, and their
home was the former residence of another ancestor, Governor
Thomas Sim Lee of Maryland. During my visit
at Needwood I renewed the acquaintance of my future
husband, which I had formed a number of years before at
the wedding of Miss Fanny Monroe and Douglas Robinson,
of which I have previously spoken. It is unnecessary
to refer to his appearance, which I have already described,
but I am sure it is not unnatural for me to add
that a year after the conclusion of the Mexican War he was
brevetted for gallantry and meritorious conduct in the
battles of Contreras and Churubusco. While his general
bearing spoke well for his military training, his mind was
a storehouse of information which I learned to appreciate
more and more as the years rolled by. But of all his fine
characteristics I valued and revered him most for his fine
sense of honor and sterling integrity. Like his mother,
Mr. Gouverneur was literary in his tastes and occasionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
gave vent to his feelings in verse. In 1852 Oak Hill, the
stately old Monroe place in Virginia where he had spent
much of his early life, was about to pass out of the family.
He was naturally much distressed over the sale of
the home so intimately associated with his childhood's
memory, and a few days prior to his final departure wrote
the following lines. In after years nothing could ever
induce him to visit Oak Hill.</p>


<p class='center'>FAREWELL TO OAK HILL, 1852, ON DEPARTING THENCE.</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The autumn rains are falling fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, the heavens are overcast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rushing winds mournful sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispering, alas! good-bye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To each fond remembrance farewell and forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oak Hill I depart to return to thee never!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mighty oaks beneath whose shade<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Scattering spray they seem to weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To each moss-grown tree farewell and forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oak Hill I depart to return to thee never!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The little mound now wild o'ergrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the bosom of which my tears have oft flown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where my mother beside her mother lies sleeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er them the rank grass, bright dew drops are weeping;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that hallowed spot farewell and forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oak Hill I depart to return to thee never!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, home of my boyhood, why must I depart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears I am shedding and wild throbs my heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home of my manhood, oh! would I had died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lain me to rest by my dead mother's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere my tongue could have uttered farewell and forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oak Hill I depart to return to thee never!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Gouverneur's pathetic allusion to the graves of his
mother and grandmother affords me an opportunity of
saying that in 1903 the Legislature of Virginia appropri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>ated
a sum of money sufficient to remove the remains of
Mrs. Monroe and her daughter, Mrs. Gouverneur, from
Oak Hill. They now rest in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond,
Virginia, on opposite sides of the grave of James
Monroe.</p>

<p>The friendship of Mr. Gouverneur and myself ripened
into a deep affection, and the winter following my visit
to Needwood we announced our engagement. I was
warmly welcomed into the Gouverneur family, as will appear
from the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I can not longer defer, my dear Marian, expressing the
great gratification I experienced when Sam informed me
of his happiness in having gained your heart. It is most
agreeable to me that you of all the women I know should
be the object of his choice. How little I anticipated such
a result from the short visit you made us last summer.
Sam is in an Elysium of bliss. I have lately had a charming
letter from him, of course all about his lady love. I
think you too have every reason to anticipate a life of
happiness, not more marred than we must all look for in
this world. Sam is very warm-hearted and affectionate
and possesses a fine mind, as you know, and when he marries,
you will have nothing to wish for. These are his
own sentiments and I assure you I entirely agree with
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Gouverneur is greatly gratified and both wrote and
told me how nobly you expressed yourself to him.</p>

<p>I am going to Baltimore to-day to meet Mr. G. and perhaps
may go to Washington. If I do you will see me
soon after I arrive there. I feel as if I should like so
much to talk to my future daughter. I take the warmest
interest in everything concerning Sam's happiness, and
my heart is now overflowing with thankfulness to you for
having contributed so much to it.</p>

<p>Please remember me in the kindest manner to your
mother, whose warm hospitality I have not forgotten, and
to the girls. My sincere congratulations to Margaret who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Mary [Lee] writes me is as happy as the day is long.
Ellen desires me to present her congratulations to you and
Margaret.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Believe me, very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">M. D. Gouverneur</span>.</p>

<p>Needwood, Feb. 14th.</p></div>

<p>I was married in Washington in the old G Street house,
and the occasion was made especially festive by the presence
of many friends from out of town. We were married
by the Rev. Dr. Smith Pyne, rector of St. John's
Episcopal Church, and I recall his nervous state of mind,
owing to the fact that he had forgotten to inquire whether
a marriage license had been procured; but when he was
assured that everything was in due form he was quite
himself again. Among those who came from New York
to attend the wedding were General Scott; my father's
old friend and associate, Hugh Maxwell; his daughter,
now the wife of Rear Admiral John H. Upshur,
U.S.N.; and Miss Sally Strother and her mother. Miss
Emily Harper and Mrs. Solomon B. Davies, who was Miss
Bettie Monroe, my husband's relative, came from Baltimore
and, of course, Mr. and Mrs. Gouverneur and Miss
Mary Lee from Needwood were also present.</p>

<p>My own family circle was small, as my sister, Mrs.
Eames, and her young children were in Venezuela, where
her husband was the U.S. Minister; but I was married in
the presence of my mother, my two younger sisters, Margaret
and Charlotte, and my brothers, James and Malcolm.
Mr. Gouverneur's only sister, Elizabeth, who some
years before had married Dr. Henry Lee Heiskell, Assistant
Surgeon General of the Army, accompanied by her
husband and son, the late James Monroe Heiskell, of Baltimore,
a handsome and promising youth, were also there.
Among the other guests were Charles Sumner, Caleb Cushing
and Stephen A. Douglas, none of whom at that time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
were married; Peter Grayson Washington, then Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, and a relative of my husband;
Miss Katharine Maria Wright, who shortly thereafter
married Baron J. C. Gevers, <i>Charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> from Holland;
her brother, Edward Wright, of Newark; John G.
Floyd of Long Island; James Guthrie, Secretary of the
Treasury, and his two daughters; William L. Marcy, Secretary
of State, and his wife; their daughter, Miss Cornelia
Marcy, subsequently Mrs. Edmund Pendleton; Baron
von Grabow and Alexandre Gau of the Prussian Legation,
the latter of whom married my sister, Margaret, the
following year; Mr. and Mrs. William T. Carroll; Lieutenant
(subsequently Rear Admiral) James S. Palmer
of the Navy; Jerome E. Kidder of Boston, and General
William J. Hardee, U.S.A.</p>

<p>A few days before my marriage I received the following
letter from Edward Everett:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, 23 Feb.</p>

<p>My dear Miss Campbell,</p>

<p>I had much pleasure in receiving this morning Mrs.
Campbell's invitation and your kind note of the 20th. I
am greatly indebted to you for remembering me on an
occasion of so much interest and importance, and I beg
to offer you my sincere congratulations.</p>

<p>Greatly would it rejoice me to be able to avail myself
of your invitation to be present at your nuptials.</p>

<p>But the state of my health and of my family makes
this impossible. But I shall certainly be with you in
spirit, and with cordial wishes for your happiness.</p>

<p>Praying my kindest remembrance to your mother and
sisters, I remain,</p>

<p class='indent2'>my dear Miss Campbell,</p>

<p class='indent3'>Sincerely your friend,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">Edward Everett</span>.</p>

<p>P.S. I suppose you saw in the papers a day or two
ago that poor Miss Russell is gone.</p></div>

<p>The Miss Russell referred to by Mr. Everett was Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Ida Russell, one of three handsome and brilliant sisters
prominent in Boston in the society of the day.</p>

<p>Soon after my marriage my husband and I made a
round of visits to his numerous family connections. It
is with more than usual pleasure that I recall the beautiful
old home of Mr. Gouverneur's aunt, Mrs. Thomas Cadwalader,
near Trenton, which a few years later was destroyed
by fire. A guest of the Cadwaladers at the same
time with ourselves was my husband's first cousin, the
Rev. Robert Livingston Tillotson of New York, who studied
for the Episcopal ministry and subsequently entered
the Roman Catholic priesthood.</p>

<p>From Trenton, we journeyed to Yonkers, New York, to
visit the Van Cortlandt family at the historic manor-house
in that vicinity. It was then owned and occupied by Mr.
Gouverneur's relatives, Dr. Edward N. Bibby and his son,
Augustus, the latter of whom had recently changed his
name from Bibby to Van Cortlandt, as a consideration for
the inheritance of this fine old estate. Dr. Bibby married
Miss Augusta White of the Van Cortlandt descent, and
for many years was a prominent physician in New York
City. When I visited the family, he had retired from
active practice and was enjoying a serene old age surrounded
by his children and grandchildren. Henry Warburton
Bibby, the Doctor's second son, was also one of
this household at the time of our visit. He never married
but retained his social tastes until his death a few
years ago.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room of the Van Cortlandt home stood
a superb pair of brass andirons in the form of lions, which
had been presented to Mrs. Augustus Van Cortlandt by
my husband's mother as a bridal present. They had been
brought by James Monroe upon his return from France,
where he had been sent upon his historic diplomatic mission
by Washington. The style of life led by the Van
Cortlandt family was fascinating to me as, even at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
late date, they clung to many of the old family customs
inherited from their ancestors. Our next visit was to the
cottage of William Kemble in Cold Spring, and it seemed
to me like returning to an old and familiar haunt. My
marriage into the Gouverneur family added another link
in the chain of friendship attaching me to the members
of the Kemble family, as they were relatives of my husband.
I was entertained while there by the whole family
connection, and I recall with especial pleasure the dinner
parties at Gouverneur Kemble's and at Mrs. Robert P.
Parrott's. Martin Van Buren was visiting "Uncle Gouv"
at the time, and I was highly gratified to meet him again,
as his presence not only revived memories of childhood's
days during my father's lifetime in New York, but also
materially assisted in rendering the entertainments given
in my honor at Cold Spring unusually delightful. From
Cold Spring we drove to The Grange, near Garrison's, another
homestead familiar to me in former days, and the
residence of Frederick Philipse, where I renewed my acquaintance
with old friends who now greeted me as a relative.
At this beautiful home I saw a pair of andirons
even handsomer than those at the Van Cortlandt mansion.
They were at least two feet high and represented trumpeters.
The historic house was replete with ancestral furniture
and fine old portraits, one of which was attributed to
Vandyke.</p>

<p>The whole Philipse and Gouverneur connection at Garrison's
were devoted Episcopalians and were largely instrumental
in building a fine church at Garrison's, which
they named St. Philips. In more recent years a congregation
of prominent families has worshiped in this edifice&mdash;among
others, the Fishes, Ardens, Livingstons, Osborns
and Sloanes. For many years the beloved rector
of this church was the Rev. Dr. Charles F. Hoffman, a
gentleman of great wealth and much scholarly ability.
He and his brother, the late Rev. Dr. Eugene A. Hoffman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Dean of the General Theological Seminary in New York,
devoted their lives and fortunes to the cause of religion.
Residents of New York are familiar with All Angels
Church, built by the late Rev. Dr. Charles F. Hoffman
on West End Avenue, of which he was rector for a number
of years. During his life at Garrison's, both Dr. and
Mrs. Hoffman were very acceptable to my husband's relatives,
especially as the Doctor was connected with the family
by right of descent from a Gouverneur forbear.
Charles F. Hoffman married Miss Eleanor Louisa Vail, a
daughter of David M. Vail of New Brunswick, New Jersey,
who in every way proved herself an able helpmeet to him.
Mrs. Hoffman was educated at Miss Hannah Hoyt's
school in New Brunswick, a fashionable institution of the
day, and at a reunion of the scholars held in recent years,
she was mentioned in the following appropriate manner:
"Nearly half a century ago, in the well-known Miss Hoyt's
school, was Eleanor Louisa Vail who was noted for her
good lessons and considerate ways towards all. She never
overlooked those who were less fortunate than herself, but
gave aid to any who needed it, either in their lessons or
in a more substantial form. In the wider circle of New
York the benevolent Mrs. Hoffman, the wife of the late
generous rector of All Angels Church, but fulfilled the
promise made by the beautiful girl of former days." Mr.
and Mrs. Charles F. Hoffman's daughter, Mrs. J. Van
Vechten Olcott, is as beloved in her generation as her
mother was before her.</p>

<p>Samuel Mongan Warburton Gouverneur, a younger
brother of Frederick Philipse, was living at The Grange
at the time of my visit. Some years later he built a handsome
house in the neighborhood which he called "Eagle's
Rest," and resided there with his sister, Miss Mary Marston
Gouverneur. After his death, the place was sold to the
late Louis Fitzgerald, who made it his home.</p>

<p>After six months spent in the mountainous regions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Maryland, not far from Cumberland, on property owned
by my husband's family, Mr. Gouverneur and I returned
to Washington and began our married life in my mother's
home. Soon after we had settled down, my eldest daughter
was born. The death of my sister, Mrs. Alexandre
Gau, from typhoid fever soon followed. It was naturally
a terrible shock to us all and especially to me, as we were
near of an age and our lives had been side by side from
infancy. My mother, in her great affliction, broke up her
home and Mr. Gouverneur and I rented a house on
Twelfth Street, near N Street, a locality then regarded as
quite suburban. Here I endeavored to live in the closest
retirement, as the meeting with friends of former days
only served to bring my sorrow more keenly before me.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my whole life was devoted to the little girl
whom we had named Maud Campbell, and who, of course,
had become "part and parcel" of my quiet life. Mr.
Gouverneur was the last surviving member of his family
in the male line, and the whole family connection was looking
to me to perpetuate his name. Soon after the birth
of my daughter my husband received the following characteristic
letter from Mr. Gouverneur's aunt, Mrs. David
Johnstone Verplanck, who before her marriage was Louisa
A. Gouverneur, a gifted woman whose home was in New
York:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Thursday</span>, April 10th.</p>

<p>My dear Sam,</p>

<p>In return for your kind recollections I hasten to offer
my most sincere congratulations to yourself and Mrs. G.
As husband and father you have now realized all the romance
of life, the pleasures of which I have little doubt
you already begin to feel deeply intermingled with many
anxious hours. It is wisest and best to enjoy all that good
fortune sends and fortify ourselves to meet and endure
the trials to which our Destiny has allotted.</p>

<p>Tell Mrs. G. that we must send for the girdle the old
woman sent the Empress Eug&eacute;nie. She had a succession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of seven sons, and requested her to wear it for luck. As
it was very dirty the royal lady sent it back. It might be
procured and undergo the purifying influence of water.
All I can say at present to console your disappointment
I hope a son will soon consummate all your joys and
wishes. You know it rests with you to keep the name of
Gouverneur in the land of the living. It is nearly extinct
and you its only salvation.</p>

<p>I regret to hear your father is unwell at Barnum's
[Hotel, Baltimore]. I hope he will soon be with us. I
long to see him.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Believe me always your friend,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">Louisa Verplanck</span>.</p></div>

<p>I also append a letter received by Mr. Gouverneur from
Mrs. William Kemble (Margaret Chatham Seth), which
recalled many tender associations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">New York</span> 11th April.</p>

<p>I need not tell you, my dear friend, how much we were
all gratified by your kind remembrance of us, in the midst
of your own anxiety and joy, to give us the first news of
our dear Marian's safety. Give my very best love to her
and a kiss to Miss Gouverneur with whom I hope to be
better acquainted hereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Nourse with our dear little Charlie left
us yesterday for Washington. You will probably see them
before you receive this. I feel assured that Marian is
blessed in being with her mother who has every experience
necessary for her. Therefore it is idle for me to give my
advice but I must say, keep her quiet, not to be too smart
or anxious to show her baby&mdash;at first&mdash;and she will be
better able to do it afterwards. May God bless you all
three and that this dear pledge committed to your charge
be to you both every comfort and joy that your anxious
hearts can wish. Please to give my best regards and
wishes to Mrs. Campbell and her daughter from</p>

<p class='indent3'>your sincerely attached friend and cousin,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">M. C. Kemble</span>.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>On the corner of Fourteenth and P Streets, and not far
from our home, was the residence of Eliab Kingman, an
intimate friend of Mr. Gouverneur's father. This locality,
now such a business center, was decidedly rural, and
Mr. Kingman's quaint and old-fashioned house was in the
middle of a small farm. It was an oddly constructed
dwelling and the interior was made unusually attractive
by its wealth of curios, among which was a large collection
of Indian relics. After his death I attended an
auction held in the old home and I remember that these
curiosities were purchased by Ben Perley Poore, the well-known
journalist. Although many years his senior, my
husband found Mr. Kingman and his home a source of
great pleasure to him, and he formed an attachment for
his father's early friend which lasted through life. The
Kingman house was the rendezvous of both literary and
political circles. William H. Seward was one of its frequent
visitors and I once heard him wittily remark that it
might appropriately be worshiped, as it resembled nothing
"that is in the Heaven above, or in the earth beneath,
or the water under the earth." For a number of years
Mr. Kingman was a correspondent of <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>
under the <i>nom de plume</i> of "Ion." His communications
were entirely confined to political topics and he was such
a skilled diplomatist that the adherents of either party,
after perusing them, might easily recognize him as their
own advocate. Thomas Seaton Donoho, of whom I shall
speak presently, was a warm friend of Mr. Kingman and
the constant recipient of his hospitality. Among his
poems is a graceful sonnet entitled</p>


<p class='indent4'>E. KINGMAN.</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ever will I remember with delight<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Mr. Kingman married Miss Cordelia Ewell of Virginia,
a relative of General Richard S. Ewell of the Confederate
Army. She was in some respects a remarkable
character, a "dyed-in-the-wool" Southerner and a woman
of unusual personal charm and ability. In dress, manner
and general appearance she presented a fitting reminder
of the <i>grande dame</i> of long ago. Her style of dress reminded
one of the Quaker school. Her gray gown with
a white kerchief crossed neatly upon her breast and her
gray hair with puffs clustered around her ears, together
with her quaint manner of courtesying as she greeted her
guests, suggested the familiar setting of an old-fashioned
picture. She was an accomplished performer upon the
harp as well as an authority upon old English literature.
In all the years I knew her I never heard of her leaving
her house. She had no children and her constant companion
was a venerable parrot.</p>

<p>John Savage, familiarly known as "Jack" Savage, was
an intimate friend of the Kingmans and also a frequent
guest of ours. He was an Irish patriot of 1848 and was
remarkable for his versatility. He had a fine voice, and I
remember seeing him on one occasion hold his audience
spell-bound while singing "The Temptation of St. Anthony."
He was an accomplished journalist and the
author of several books, one of which, "The Modern Revolutionary
History and Literature of Ireland," has been
pronounced the best work extant "on the last great revolutionary
era of the Irish race."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Civil War I often met at Mr. Kingman's
house General Benjamin F. Butler, whose withering gift
of sarcasm is still remembered. Simon Cameron, Lincoln's
first Secretary of War, was also a frequent visitor there.
He was an unusually genial and cordial gentleman, and
some years later Mr. Kingman and my husband, upon his
urgent invitation, visited him at his handsome country
place, Lochiel, in Pennsylvania. His fine graperies made
such a vivid impression upon my husband that his description
of them almost enabled me to see the luscious
fruit itself before me.</p>

<p>My old friends, Purser Horatio Bridge, U.S.N., and
his wife, lived on the corner of K and Fourteenth Streets
at a hotel then known as the Rugby House. Mrs. Bridge
was a sister of the famous beauty, Miss Emily Marshall,
who married Harrison Gray Otis of Boston. Mr. Bridge,
while on the active list, had been stationed for a time in
Washington and, finding the life congenial and attractive,
returned here after his retirement and with his wife made
his home at the Rugby House. While there the hotel was
offered for sale and was bought by Mr. Bridge, who enlarged
it and changed its name to The Hamilton, in compliment
to Mrs. Hamilton Holly, an intimate friend of
Mrs. Bridge and the daughter of Alexander Hamilton.
Mrs. Holly, my old and cherished friend, lived in a picturesque
cottage on I Street, on the site of the present
Russian embassy, where so many years later the wife and
daughter of Benjamin F. Tracy, Harrison's Secretary of
the Navy, lost their lives in a fire that destroyed the house.
Among the attractions of this home was a remarkable collection
of Hamilton relics which subsequent to Mrs. Holly's
death was sold at public auction. The sale, however, did
not attract any particular attention, as the craze for antiques
had not yet developed and the souvenir fiend was
then unknown.</p>

<p>It was while I was living on Twelfth Street that I first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
met Miss Margaret Edes, so well known in after years to
Washingtonians. She was visiting her relatives, the Donoho
family, which lived in my immediate vicinity. Her
host's father was connected with <i>The National Intelligencer</i>,
and the son, Thomas Seaton Donoho, was named
after William Winston Seaton, one of its editors. Thomas
Seaton Donoho was a truly interesting character. He was
decidedly romantic in his ideas and many incidents of his
life were curiously associated with the ivy vine. He
planted a sprig of it in front of his three-story house,
which was built very much upon the plan of every other
dwelling in the neighborhood, and called his abode "Ivy
Hall"; while his property in the vicinity of Washington
he named "Ivy City," a locality so well known to-day by
the same name to the sporting fraternity. His book of
poems, published in Washington in 1860, is entitled "Ivy-wall";
and, to cap the climax, when a girl was born into
the Donoho family she was baptized in mid-ocean as "Atlantic
May Ivy." In addition to his poems, he published,
in 1850, a drama in three acts, entitled, "Goldsmith of Padua,"
and two years later "Oliver Cromwell," a tragedy
in five acts.</p>

<p>Soon after my marriage, Mr. Gouverneur acted as one
of the pallbearers at the funeral of his early friend, Gales
Seaton, the son of William Winston Seaton, and a most
accomplished man of affairs. In those days honorary pallbearers
were unknown and the coffin was borne to the
grave by those with whom the deceased had been most intimately
associated. The Seatons owned a family vault,
and the body was carried down into it by Mr. Seaton's old
friends. After the funeral I heard Mr. Gouverneur speak
of observing a coffin which held the remains of Mrs. Francis
Schroeder, who was Miss Caroline Seaton, and whose
husband, the father of Rear Admiral Seaton Schroeder,
U.S.N., was at one time U.S. Minister to Sweden and
Norway. Seaton Munroe, a nephew of Gales Seaton, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
prominent in Washington society. He never married and
many persons regarded him as the Ward McAllister of the
Capital. When Colonel Sanford C. Kellogg, U.S.A., then
military <i>attach&eacute;</i> of the U.S. Embassy in Paris, heard of
Munroe's death, he wrote to a mutual friend: "I do not
believe the man lives who has done more for the happiness
and welfare of others than Seaton Munroe." He was one
of the prominent founders of the Metropolitan Club,
which commenced its career in the old Morris house on the
corner of Vermont Avenue and H Street; and later, when
it moved to the Graham residence on the corner of Fifteenth
and H Streets, he continued to be one of its most
popular and influential members.</p>

<p>In April, 1858, occurred the famous Gwin ball, so readily
recalled by old Washingtonians. It was a fancy-dress
affair, and it was the intention of Senator and Mrs. William
McKendree Gwin of California that it should be the
most brilliant of its kind that the National Capital had
ever known. Of course Mr. Gouverneur and I did not attend,
owing to my deep mourning, but I shall always remember
the pleasure and amusement we derived in dressing
Mr. Kingman for the occasion. We decked him out
in the old court dress which Mr. Gouverneur's grandfather,
James Monroe, wore during his diplomatic mission
in France. As luck would have it the suit fitted him perfectly,
and the next day it was quite as gratifying to us
as to Mr. Kingman to hear that the costume attracted
marked attention.</p>

<p>The ball was rightly adjudged a brilliant success.
Among the guests was President Buchanan, though not,
of course, in fancy dress. Senator Gwin represented
Louis Quatorze; Ben Perley Poore, "Major Jack Downing";
Lord Napier, George Hammond&mdash;the first British
Minister to the United States; Mrs. Stephen A. Douglas,
Aurora; Mrs. Jefferson Davis, Madame de Sta&euml;l; and so
on down the list. It is probable that the wife of Senator<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Clement C. Clay, of Alabama, who represented Mrs.
Partington, attracted more attention and afforded more
amusement than any other guest. Washington had fairly
teemed with her brilliant repartee and other bright sayings,
and upon this occasion she was, if possible, more than
ever in her element. She had a witty encounter with the
President and a familiar home-thrust for all whom she
encountered. Many of the public characters present,
when lashed by her sparkling humor, were either unable
or unwilling to respond. She was accompanied by "Ike,"
Mrs. Partington's son, impersonated by a clever youth of
ten years, son of John M. Sandidge of Louisiana. Mr.
John Von Sonntag Haviland, formerly of the U.S. Army,
wrote a metrical description of this ball, and in referring
to Mrs. Clay, thus expresses himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mark how the grace that gilds an honored name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives a strange zest to that loquacious dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose ready tongue and easy blundering wit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provoke fresh uproar at each happy hit!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Note how her humour into strange grimace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempts the smooth meekness of yon Quaker's face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But&mdash;denser grows the crowd round Partington;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere vain to try to name them one by one.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Haviland added this to the above:&mdash;"Mrs. Senator
Clay, with knitting in hand, snuff-box in pocket, and
'Ike, the Inevitable,' by her side, acted out her difficult
character so as to win the unanimous verdict that her personation
of the loquacious <i>mal-aprops</i> dame was the leading
feature of the evening's entertainment. Go where she
would through the spacious halls, a crowd of eager listeners
followed her footsteps, drinking in her instant repartees,
which were really superior in wit and appositeness,
and, indeed, in the vein of the famous dame's <i>caco&euml;thes</i>,
even to the original contribution of Shillaber to the nonsensical
literature of the day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the guests at this ball was the wife of the late
Major General William H. Emery, U.S.A., whose maiden
name was Matilda Bache. She was arrayed for the evening
in the garb of a Quakeress, and it is to her that Mr.
Haviland alludes in his reference to the "smooth meekness
of yon Quaker's face."</p>

<p>At the commencement of the Civil War, Senator Gwin
was arrested on a charge of disloyalty and imprisoned until
1863. He then went to Paris, where he became interested
in a scheme for the colonization by Southerners of
the State of Sonora in Mexico, in consequence of which
he was sometimes facetiously called the "Duke of Sonora."
While thus engaged, he was invited to meet the Emperor,
Napoleon III., in private audience, and succeeded in enlisting
his sympathies. It is said that, upon the request
of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he formulated a plan
for the colony which, after receiving the Emperor's approval,
was submitted to Maximilian. The latter was then
in Paris and requested Mr. Gwin's attendance at the
Tuileries where, after diligent inquiry, the scheme received
the approbation of Maximilian. Two weeks after
the departure of the latter for Mexico, Mr. Gwin left for
the same country, carrying with him an autograph letter
of Napoleon III. to Marshal Bazaine. The scheme, however,
received no encouragement from the latter, and Maximilian
failed to give him any satisfactory assurances of
his support. Returning to France in 1865, he secured an
audience with the Emperor, to whom he exposed the condition
of affairs in Mexico. Napoleon urged him to return
to that country immediately with a peremptory order
to Marshal Bazaine to supply a military force adequate to
accomplish the project. This request was complied with
but Mr. Gwin, after meeting with no success, demanded
an escort to accompany him out of the country. This was
promptly furnished, and he returned to his home in California.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems fitting in this connection to speak of a brilliant
ball in Washington in 1824. Although, of course, I
do not remember it, I have heard of it all my life and have
gathered here and there certain facts of interest concerning
it, some of which are not easily accessible. I refer
to the ball given by Mrs. John Quincy Adams, whose husband
was then Secretary of State under Monroe. Mrs.
Adams' maiden name was Louisa Catharine Johnson and
she was a daughter of Joshua Johnson, who served as
our first United States Consul at London, and a niece of
Thomas Johnson of Maryland. She gave receptions in
Washington on Tuesday evenings which were attended
by many of the most distinguished men and women
of the day. This period, in fact, is generally regarded
as, perhaps, the most brilliant era in Washington society.
A generous hospitality was dispensed by such men
as Madison, Monroe, Adams, Calhoun, Wirt, Rush, Southard,
General Winfield Scott and General Alexander
Macomb. The British <i>Charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> at this time was
Henry Unwin Addington. The Russian Minister was the
Baron de Tuyll; while France, Spain and Portugal were
represented by gentlemen of distinguished manners and
rare accomplishments. The illustrious John Marshall was
Chief Justice, with Joseph Story, Bushrod Washington,
Smith Thompson and other eminent jurists by his side.
In Congress were such men as Henry Clay, William Gaston,
Rufus King, Daniel Webster, Andrew Jackson,
Thomas H. Benton, William Jones Lowndes, John Jordan
Crittenden and Harrison Gray Otis; while the Navy was
represented by Stephen Decatur, David Porter, John
Rodgers, Lewis Warrington, Charles Stewart, Charles
Morris and others, some of whom made their permanent
home at the Capital.</p>

<p>The ball given by the Secretary of State and Mrs.
Adams was in honor of General Andrew Jackson, and
was not only an expression of the pleasant personal re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>lations
existing between John Quincy Adams and Jackson
only shortly before the former defeated the latter
for the Presidency, but also a pleasing picture of Washington
society at that time. General Jackson was naturally
the hero of the occasion, and there was a throng of
guests not only from Washington but also from Baltimore,
Richmond and other cities. A current newspaper
of the day published a metrical description of the event,
written by John T. Agg:</p>

<p>The "Mrs. Sullivan" referred to was Sarah Bowdoin
Winthrop, the wife of George Sullivan of Boston, son of
Governor James Sullivan of Massachusetts; while "Winning
Gales" was the wife of Joseph Gales, editor of <i>The
National Intelligencer</i>. "Forsyth" was the wife of Senator
John Forsyth of Georgia, who subsequently served
as Secretary of State during Jackson's administration;
and "the Crowninshields in blue" were daughters of
Benjamin W. Crowninshield, Secretary of the Navy under
Madison and Monroe. "The Pierces, with their heavenly
faces," were handsome Boston women who in after life
became converts to the Roman Catholic faith and entered
convents. The "Vails" were Eugene and Aaron Vail,
who were prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of Senator William H. Crawford, of
Georgia. They married sisters, daughters of Laurent
Salles, a wealthy Frenchman living in New York. Aaron
Vail accompanied Martin Van Buren to England as Secretary
of Legation and for a season, after Van Buren's
recall, acted as <i>Charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>. "Tayloe" was Benjamin
Ogle Tayloe, the distinguished Washingtonian.
"Ramsay" was General George Douglas Ramsay, the
father of Rear Admiral Francis M. Ramsay, U.S.N.; and
"Hellen" was Mrs. Adams's niece, who subsequently became
her daughter-in-law through her marriage to her
son, John Adams. President Monroe attended this ball
and both he and John Quincy Adams were somewhat
criticised for their plain attire, which was in such striking
contrast with the elaborate costumes and decorations
worn by the foreign guests.</p>

<p>In his boyhood Mr. Gouverneur formed an intimacy
with George H. Derby, better known in literary circles
under the <i>nom de plume</i> of "John Phoenix." He is well
remembered by students of American humor as a contemporary
and rival of Artemus Ward. He was a member
of a prominent Boston family, and of the class of 1846
at West Point. He was a gallant soldier, having been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
wounded during the Mexican War at Cerro Gordo, and
was promoted for his bravery in that battle. Scarcely
anyone was immune from his practical jokes, but, fortunately
for his peace of mind, Mr. Gouverneur was acquainted
with an incident of his life which, if known,
would make him a butt of ridicule; and he accordingly
felt perfectly safe in his companionship and well enjoyed
his humorous exploits. One day Derby and Mr. Gouverneur
were sauntering through the streets of Washington
when the keen eye of the humorist was attracted by a sign
over a store door which read, "Ladies' Depository"&mdash;the
old-fashioned method of designating what would now be
called a "Woman's Exchange." Turning to his companion,
Derby remarked: "I have a little business to transact
in this shop and I want you to go inside with me." They
entered and were met by a smiling female to whom Derby
remarked: "My wife will be here to-morrow morning. I
am so pleased to have discovered this depository. I hope
that you will take good care of her. Expect her at eleven.
Good-morning."</p>

<p>In the early '50's Adjutant General Roger Jones determined
to adopt a new uniform for the U.S. Army, and
Derby was thus afforded a conspicuous opportunity to exercise
his wit. He was an excellent draughtsman and
set to work and produced a design. He proposed changing
the entire system of modern tactics by the aid of an
iron hook to be attached to the seat of each soldier's
trousers, this hook to be used by the three arms of the service&mdash;cavalry,
infantry and artillery. He illustrated it by
a series of well-executed designs, and quoted high medical
authority to prove its advantages from a sanitary point
of view. He argued that the heavy knapsack induced a
stooping position and a contraction of the chest but, hung
on a hook by a strap over the shoulders, it would brace
the body and back and expand the chest. The cavalrymen
were to be rendered more secure in their seats when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
hooked to a ring in the saddle. All commissioned officers
were to carry a light twenty-foot pole, with a ring attached
to the end, to be used during an engagement in drawing
stragglers back into the ranks. He made a drawing of a
tremendous battle during which the Generals and Colonels
were thus occupied, and in many other ways expatiated
upon the value of the hook. When Jefferson Davis, the
Secretary of War, saw Derby's designs and read his
recommendations, he felt that his dignity was wounded
and the service insulted, and he immediately issued an
order that Derby be court-martialed. William L. Marcy,
then Secretary of State, was told of the transaction and of
the cloud hanging over Derby. He looked over the drawings
and saw a regiment, their backs towards him and
drawn up in line, with knapsacks, blankets and everything
appertaining to camp life attached to each soldier by a
hook. Marcy, who saw the humorous side at once, said to
Davis: "It's no use to court-martial this man. The matter
will be made public and the laugh will be upon us.
Besides, a man who has the inventive genius that he has
displayed, as well as the faculty of design, ill-directed
though they be, is too valuable to the service to be trifled
with." Derby therefore was not brought to grief, and in
time Davis's anger was sufficiently mollified for him to
enjoy the joke. I am enabled to state, through the
courtesy of the present Assistant Secretary of War, that
the drawings referred to are not now to be found in the
files of the War Department; and a picture, which at the
time was the source of untold amusement and of wide-spread
notoriety, seems to be lost to the world.</p>

<span class="caption">Miniature of James Monroe, Painted in Paris in 1794, by Sem&eacute;.</span><br />
<span class='caption2'><i>Original owned by Mrs. Gouverneur.</i></span>
</div>

<p>An incident connected with the Indian War of 1856-58,
in Washington Territory, furnished another outlet for
Derby's effective wit. A Catholic priest was taken prisoner
by the savages at that time and led away into captivity,
and in caricaturing the scene Derby represented
an ecclesiastic in full canonicals walking between two stal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>wart
and half-naked Indians, carrying a crook and crozier,
with a tooth-brush attached to one and a comb to the
other; while the letters "I. H. S." on the priest's chasuble
were paraphrased into the words, "I hate Siwashes." It
must not be thought, however, that Derby's life was wholly
devoted to fun and frivolity, for he has been pronounced
by an accomplished military writer and critic to have been
"an able and accomplished engineer." He was the author
of "The Squibob Papers" and of "Phoenixiana; or
Sketches and Burlesques," either of which would worthily
place him in the forefront of humorists in the history of
American literature. I own a copy of the latter book
which was given by the author to my husband. It seems
strange, when one considers the character and career of
this gifted man, that subsequent to his death nearly every
member of his family should have met with a tragic end.</p>

<p>Although not a practical joker, my husband found much
in Derby that was congenial, as many of their tastes were
similar. Both of them were devoted to literature and
both were accomplished writers; but while Derby published
his works and was rewarded with financial success,
Mr. Gouverneur wrote chiefly for the newspaper press.
He edited and published a work by James Monroe, entitled
"The People the Sovereigns," but never sent to the
press any works of his own production. I think that the
lack of encouragement from me was the chief obstacle that
deterred him from embarking upon a literary career. He
commenced several novels but never finished them, and
his chief literary remains are principally confined to the
limits of his "commonplace-books."</p>

<p>President Buchanan's niece, Harriet Lane, subsequently
Mrs. Henry Elliott Johnston of Maryland, presided with
grace and dignity over the White House during her uncle's
administration. I first met Miss Lane before the period
when Buchanan represented the United States at the
Court of St. James. It was at a party given by Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Hamilton Fish, whose husband was then a U.S. Senator
from the State of New York. Her blond type of beauty
made an indelible impression upon me, as she was very
much the same style as the daughters of General Winfield
Scott. Some years before her death, while she was living
in Washington, I incidentally referred to this resemblance
between the Scotts and herself and was not surprised
to hear her say that others had spoken of it. To
an exceptionally fine presence, she added unusual intelligence
and brilliant power of repartee. I have often heard
the story that at a social function at the White House an
accomplished courtier was enlarging to Miss Lane upon
her shapely hands&mdash;"hands," he ejaculated, "that might
have swayed the rod of empire." Her retort came without
a moment's hesitation, "or wake to ecstasy the living
lyre." Emily Schomberg, who married Hughes Hallett
of England, wrote some years ago a charming sketch of
Harriet Lane Johnston which was published in Mrs. Elizabeth
F. Ellet's book entitled, "The Court Circles of the
Republic."</p>

<p>Among the prominent belles of the Buchanan administration,
and an intimate friend and companion of Harriet
Lane, was Rebecca B. Black, daughter of the eminent jurist,
Judge Jeremiah S. Black of Pennsylvania, Attorney-General
and for a time Secretary of State under
Buchanan. She was the widow of Isham Hornsby of
Washington, where, in her beautiful home, she was surrounded
by a charming circle and was much admired and
beloved. Peter Grayson Washington, a son of Lund
Washington, whom I have already mentioned in connection
with my wedding, was a conspicuous figure at the
National Capital during the Buchanan <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. During
the Pierce administration he was Assistant Secretary of
the Treasury under James Guthrie. He had an impressive
bearing, and carried a gold-headed cane which he boasted
had originally belonged to his distinguished relative, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
first President. Although by birth a Virginian, Mr. Washington
never wavered in his loyalty to the Union. During
the latter part of the Civil War he made a visit to us
in our Maryland home, and I shall always remember the
expression of his opinion that many leaders of the Confederate
cause were not true representatives of the South,
citing as examples some members of Jefferson Davis's
cabinet. He concluded his remarks with the facetious
statement that "if they had only chosen a second Washington
as a leader they might have been successful."
Earlier residents of the District will recall Littleton
Quinton Washington, a prolific writer chiefly upon political
subjects, and a younger half-brother of Peter G.
Washington.</p>

<p>My old and valued friend, Mrs. Hamilton Holly, and
Peter Grayson Washington were the Godparents of my
eldest daughter. At the earnest request of the former,
this ceremony took place in the house of Mrs. Alexander
Hamilton, in the De Menou buildings. Mrs. Holly and I
characterized the gathering as a revolutionary party, as
so many of the guests bore names prominent during our
struggle for independence. I never saw Mrs. Hamilton
Holly again. Shortly after this pleasant function I sailed
for China, and just before starting on my long voyage I
received the following note, which saddened me more than
I can well express:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Sep.</span> 9th.</p>

<p>My dear friend,</p>

<p>For many days I have been blessed by your very kind
letter, but am too, too low to answer it. One day so weak
as to be obliged with my hand to wave Mrs. Furguson
away (another lady obtained admittance), lest in the effort
to converse I might find another home. My hand and
head are exhausted.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Most truly yours,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">E. H. Holly</span>.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>SOJOURN IN CHINA AND RETURN</h3>


<p>Prior to the Civil War, Mr. Gouverneur received an
appointment from James Buchanan as U.S. Consul
to Foo Chow in China, and I decided to accompany
him upon his long journey. Meanwhile a second
daughter had been added to our family, much to the disappointment
of the large circle of relatives who were still
anxiously expecting me to hand down the name of Gouverneur.
We named her Ruth Monroe. We took passage
upon the clipper ship <i>Indiaman</i>, a vessel of heavy
tonnage sailing from New York and commanded by a
"down-east" skipper named Smith. No railroads crossed
the American continent in those days, and the voyage to
the far East had to be made either around Cape Horn or
by way of the Isthmus of Panama or around the Cape
of Good Hope. We selected the latter route, leaving
New York in October and arriving in Shanghai the following
March. My preparations for such a protracted
journey with two very young children were carefully and
even elaborately planned but, to my dismay, some of the
most important articles of food for the childrens' diet
became unfit for use long before we reached our destination.
As one may readily imagine, I was accordingly
put to my wits' end for substitutes. We also provided
ourselves with a goodly amount of literature, and more
particularly books relating to China, among which were
Father Evariste R&eacute;gis Huc's volume on "The Chinese
Empire," and Professor S. Wells Williams's work on
"The Middle Kingdom." We read these <i>en route</i> with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
great interest but discovered after a few months' residence
in the East that no book or pen we then knew
conveyed an adequate idea of that remarkable country.</p>

<p>We had a very favorable voyage, and sailing in the
trade winds in the Southern hemisphere was to me the
very acme of bliss. I was thoroughly in sympathy with
the passage of Humboldt where he speaks of the tropical
skies and vegetation in the following beautiful manner:&mdash;"He
on whom the Southern Cross has never gleamed nor
the Centaur frowned, above whom the clouds of Magellan
have never circled, who has never stood within the shadow
of great palms, nor clothed himself with the gloom of the
primeval forests, does not know how the soul seems to
have a new birth in the midst of these new and splendid
surroundings. Nowhere but under the equatorial skies
is it permitted to man to behold at once and in the same
sweep of the eye all the stars of both the Northern and
Southern heavens; and nowhere but at the tropics does
nature combine to produce the various forms of vegetation
that are parceled out separately to other climes."</p>

<p>The patience of our captain was sorely tried by the
lack of wind while passing through the Doldrums. This
nautical locality, varying in breadth from sixty to several
hundred miles and shifting in extreme limits at different
seasons of the year, is near the equator and abounds in
calms, squalls and light, baffling winds which sometimes
prevent the progress of sailing vessels for weeks at a time.
When we finally emerged from the Doldrums, we were
compensated for the trying delay by greeting the trade
winds so cherished by the hearts of mariners. We sailed
many leagues south of the Cape of Good Hope and much
too far away even to catch a glimpse of it, but we realized
its proximity by the presence of the Cape pigeons which
hovered around our vessel. The albatross was also our
daily visitor and one or two of them were caught by the
sailors, regardless of the superstition of possible calamity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
attending such an act. Our only stop during the long
voyage was at the Moluccas or Spice Islands, in the Malay
Peninsula, and was made at the request of the passengers
who were desirous of exploring the beauties of that tropical
region. The waters surrounding these islands were
as calm as a lake and all around our ship floated the d&eacute;bris
of spices. The vegetation was more beautiful than
I can describe and the shells which covered the shores
were eagerly collected by the passengers.</p>

<p>Our fellow voyagers were four missionaries, who on
Sundays conducted divine service, and a Mr. Pemberton,
a young Canadian who was <i>en voyage</i> to join the <i>Hong</i>
of Purden and Company in Shanghai. In these early
days it was the custom of parents of refractory or adventurous
sons to place them on board sailing vessels for
lengthy outings. Occasionally they were sent upon whaling
voyages, where the hardships were greater and the
voyage more prolonged. On the <i>Indiaman</i> there were several
of these youths and it was quite pathetic as well as
comical to see them ascend the rigging amid the jeers of
a well-disciplined crew. One of them, whose father had
occupied an official position in the City of New York, had
been quite a society "swell" and claimed acquaintance
with me. At times he was required by the captain to
hold my younger child, a mere babe, in the arms. Every
now and then we were startled by her shrieks and for
quite a time we could not detect the cause until we finally
discovered that his task was uncongenial and that, in
order to get rid of his charge, the incorrigible youth had
administered an occasional pinch.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon while sailing in the Indian
Ocean we had a narrow escape from shipwreck. Every
sail was set to catch the least breath of air, and Mr. Gouverneur
and the children were on deck with the captain,
when in the distance they saw what seemed to resemble a
huge wall. The moment the experienced eye of our skip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>per
saw it he exclaimed, "My God, we are gone!" It
slowly but surely approached our ship and when it reached
us its force was so great that our sails almost dipped into
the ocean. The ship, however, gradually righted itself
and we were naturally more than grateful for our deliverance.
I chanced to be resting in my cabin at the perilous
moment and in a most unceremonious manner was
thrown to the floor. After reaching the mouth of that
stupendous river, the Yangtze Kiang, we thought our long
voyage was nearly ended, but we soon discovered that we
had not yet "crossed the Rubicon," and that trouble was
still in store for us. We had just passed the mouth of this
river and cast anchor when, to our surprise and dismay,
we encountered a severe storm, and during the night
dragged anchor for about twenty miles. The morning,
however, dawned bright and clear, but our captain,
who had lost his temper during the storm, did not accord
the Chinese pilots who boarded us a very gracious reception.
This was my first glimpse of the Chinese within
the limits of their own domain.</p>

<p>When we reached the city of Shanghai it was quite dark,
but we found coolies awaiting us with chairs. I shall
never forget my first impressions of China. All of my
anticipations of the beautiful Orient were fully realized,
and, as I was carried through the crowded streets, visions
of the Arabian Nights enchanted me and it seemed to me
a veritable region of delight. The streets of Shanghai,
however, after the broad thoroughfares of Washington,
appeared like small and complicated pathways. They
were not lighted with public lamps at this time, but myriads
of lanterns of every conceivable shape and color carried
by wayfarers met the eye at every turn and made the
whole scene appear like fairyland. But, alas, the following
morning I was undeceived, for daylight revealed to
my vision a very squalid and dirty city. We were carried
to the largest hotel in Shanghai, where it seemed as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
though I were almost receiving a home greeting when the
sign over the door told me that it was the Astor House!
Still another surprise awaited me. Although in a
strange land, one of the first persons to welcome me was
a former acquaintance, the wife of Mr. Robert Morrison
Olyphant, the head of the prominent <i>Hong</i> of Olyphant
and Company. Her maiden name was Anna O. Vernon
and I had formerly known her quite well in New York
and Newport.</p>

<p>We did not linger long in Shanghai, but embraced the
first opportunity to reach Foo Chow. It was a coast voyage
of several days and was attended with much discomfort,
as the choppy seas through which we sailed made all
of us very ill&mdash;a remarkable experience, considering the
fact that during the whole of our protracted voyage we
had not suffered an uncomfortable moment. We reached
Foo Chow, however, in due time, and Mr. Gouverneur at
once assumed his official duties. Foo Chow is called by
the natives <i>Hok Chiu</i>, or "Happy City." It is also what
is termed a "Foo-City," signifying a place of the largest
magnitude, and was the sole Chinese port where royalty
was represented. It is situated upon the Min River,
about twenty-five miles from its mouth, and is the capital
of the Province of Fokien. The navigation of the river
Min was regarded as dangerous, and the insurance rates
for vessels navigating it were higher than those of any
other Chinese port. The place is surrounded by castellated
walls nine or ten miles in circumference, outside of
which are suburbs as extensive as the city itself. Its
walls are about thirty feet high and twelve wide at the
top. Its seven gates are overlooked by high towers, while
small guardhouses stand at frequent intervals along the
walls.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival in Foo Chow we found no house provided
for the U.S. Consul, and immediately made our
residence with a missionary family, where we were most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
comfortable, until the <i>Hong</i> of Augustus Heard and Company
provided us with a residence for which we paid
rent. The English government took better care of its representative.
Not far from us was the British Consulate,
a fine building reminding one in certain respects of the
White House. In another residence near by, and provided
by his government, lived the British interpreter, a
Scotchman named Milne. Walter H. Medhurst, the British
Consul, and his interpreter were descendants of early
English missionaries. We found Foo Chow to be a somewhat
lawless city. Many of its inhabitants were mountaineers
from the surrounding region who had become
pretty well starved out and had found their way into the
city. As a result of their early training, they gave the
authorities much trouble.</p>

<p>I was naturally much impressed by some of the novel
and curious customs then prevalent. The seat of honor
assigned a guest was on the left of the host. The uncovered
head for a man was a mark of disrespect and a servant
would accordingly be severely reprimanded if he appeared
before his master with his hat off. Persons in
mourning wore white, in striking contrast with the somber
apparel used by ourselves. The shoe polish in vogue was
a chalky white substance. From these and other examples
it can readily be seen I was justified in feeling that I had
been transferred to another planet and had left "dull
earth behind me." When we reached Foo Chow, the
gorgeous flowers and other vegetation were at their best.
The month of April was a season set apart by the Chinese
to decorate with flowers the graves of their ancestors;
and coming from a land where such a ceremony was unknown,
it impressed me as a beautiful custom. It suggests,
moreover, the inquiry as to whether it was from the
Chinese, or from an innate conviction of the beautiful
sentiment demanding an outward expression, that induced
the descendants of the Blue and the Gray, at a later pe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>riod,
to strew with flowers the last resting-places of those
whose memories they delighted to honor.</p>

<p>Next door to the U.S. Consulate lived a Parsee named
Botelwalla, who was an English subject. He never uncovered
his head, and his tarpaulin hat carried me back
to the pictures in my geography while studying at Miss
Forbes's school. He was extensively engaged in the
opium trade, and had large quantities of it stored in his
dwelling. One day he came to our home to make a social
visit and, taking it for granted that he was a fire-worshiper,
I inquired whether he came from Persia. He told
me that twelve hundred years ago his family emigrated
from that country to India, where their descendants had
since resided. I recall an incident which convinced me
at the time that he was not a consistent follower of his
own religion. Mr. Gouverneur noticed smoke issuing one
day from what he thought was a remote portion of the
Botelwalla home, and immediately called out to the Parsee
from an adjoining window that his house was on fire.
Without a moment's hesitation, he got all of his family
together, and for a while they worked most strenuously
to subdue the flames and to save from destruction the
hundred thousand dollars' worth of opium lodged in the
Parsee's home. Somewhat later we were surprised to
learn that it was our own kitchen which was on fire.
Our ignorance was due to the fact that the walls of the
two houses were so irregular and so oddly constructed
that it was at first exceedingly difficult, upon a superficial
view, to distinguish certain portions of our own home from
those of our neighbor. The one feature, however, connected
with the fire which impressed us most forcibly was the
fact that Botelwalla, our neighbor and fire-worshiper, did
not allow his religious scruples to interfere with the safety
of his valuable personal possessions. My attention, as
well as admiration, was frequently directed to a number
of superb India cashmere shawls which I often saw airing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
on his upper veranda and which, I think, were used for
bed coverings.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival in Foo Chow, Mr. Gouverneur
was fortunate in securing the services of a Chinese interpreter
named Ling Kein, a mandarin of high order,
who wore the "blue button," significant of his rank. In
addition to this distinction he wore on his hat the peacock
feather, an official reward of merit. He was a Chinese
of remarkable intelligence, well versed in English as well
as in the Chinese vernacular, and was also the master of
several dialects. He surprised me by his familiarity with
New York, and upon inquiry I learned that he had once
taken a junk into that port, which was naturally regarded
with great curiosity by the Gothamites. He remembered
many prominent New Yorkers, one of whom
was Daniel Lord, the distinguished lawyer, whom he had
met in a professional relation. He also recalled my old
friend and Mr. Gouverneur's kinsman, William Kemble,
who lived next door to Mr. Lord opposite St. John's Park.
Ling Kein and his family lived in our house, but they led
such secluded lives that I seldom saw them; indeed, we
never laid eyes upon our interpreter except when his
presence was required. He was not in the employ of our
government, but his salary of one hundred dollars a month
was paid from my husband's private means. His services
were invaluable and when we first began housekeeping
he secured our domestic staff for us. The butler was
Ning Ping, a Christianized Chinese, who took entire
charge of the establishment&mdash;going to market, regulating
the servants and even handing them their wages.
For his services he received four dollars a month.</p>

<p>I found this mode of life ideally pleasant and easy until
I heard an uproar one day in the servants' quarters in
which my two nurses seemed to be involved. I was entirely
ignorant as to the cause of the commotion and for
some time held my peace, as one of the first lessons I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
learned in China was not to probe too deeply into domestic
affairs, since one derived but little satisfaction from
the attempt. As the confusion continued, however, I summoned
Ling Kein in order to ascertain the cause of it.
It seems that Ning Ping had paid the women their wages
in Mexican dollars which were not of the proper weight.
There prevailed a crafty method of clipping or punching
the coins, and this dishonest Chinaman had taken advantage
of those whom he thought to be simply unsophisticated
women. The trouble was finally quelled by an
agreement that in future I should personally pay the
nurses their wages. I gave each of these women four dollars
a month for their services. Our cook, Ting Ting,
who was a chef, and the four coolies, who were the chair
bearers, were also paid four dollars a month each. The
gatekeeper, whose duties were to open and close the front
gate and to look after the chairs of visitors, received a
similar sum for his services. I also employed by the
month a native tailor, whose sole requirements for his
work were a chair and a table. He did the entire sewing
of the establishment and charged four dollars a month
for his labor. At least one of my experiences with him
failed to confirm the extraordinary powers of imitation
possessed by the Chinese, for upon one occasion when I
trusted him with a handsome garment, with strict injunctions
to follow the model I gave him, he completely
ignored my instructions and carried out his own
designs.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, this retinue of retainers provided
its own food and clothing, and I was in blissful ignorance
as to where they stowed themselves away for the
night. A laundryman called once a week for our clothes
and his charges were two dollars a hundred for articles
of every description. I am almost ashamed to acknowledge
that I never saw the interior of our kitchen, but our
cook served our dinners in the most approved manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
We frequently had guests to dine with us and as the butler,
Ning Ping, was as much an expert in his department
as the cook, Ting Ting, was in his, I was delightfully
irresponsible and often wondered, as I sat at my own
table, what the next course would be. Our guests were
principally men, usually the senior members of <i>Hongs</i>
and officers of war-ships lying in the harbor, and it was the
custom of each to bring with him his "boy," who stood
behind him throughout the repast.</p>

<p>There was quite a number of missionaries in the city,
and each religious denomination provided its ministers
with comfortable quarters. The Baptists were especially
well represented and also the "American Board," which
was established in Boston in 1812. The English residents
had a small chapel of their own which was well sustained
by them. There was one missionary who commanded
my especial respect and admiration. I refer to
the Rev. Mr. William C. Burns, a Scotch Presbyterian
clergyman. He led a life of consecrated self-denial, living
exclusively with the natives and dressing in the Chinese
garb which, with his Caucasian features and blond
complexion, caused him to present the drollest appearance.
Only those who have resided in China can understand
the repugnance with which anyone accustomed to
the amenities of refined society would naturally regard
such a life. He gave up body and soul to the spread of
Christianity in a heathen land, recalling to my mind the
early Jesuits, Francis Xavier, Lucas Caballero and
Cipriano Baraza, who penetrated pathless forests and
crossed unknown seas in conformity with the requirements
of their sacred mission. Mr. Burns died in China in
the earnest pursuit of his vocation. I own a copy of his
life published in New York in 1870, soon after his death.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church was well represented in
Foo Chow and was under the general direction of the
order of the Dominicans. Each portion of China, in fact,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
even the most remote, was under the jurisdiction of some
Roman Catholic Order, so that directly or indirectly almost
every Chinaman in the Empire was reached. The
Catholics also had a large orphan asylum in Foo Chow,
over whose portals, in Chinese characters, was the verse
from the Psalms: "When my father and my mother forsake
me, then the Lord will take me up." Nothing
brought back to me my far-away Western home more
pleasantly than the tones of the Angelus sounding from
the belfry of this institution.</p>

<p>There was a native orphan asylum in Foo Chow, not
far from the American Consulate&mdash;a fact I have never
seen stated in any of the numerous books I have read relating
to the "Middle Kingdom." With true Chinese insight,
the largest salary was paid the nurse who successfully
reared the greatest number of babies. When I lived
in China, the laws for the prevention of infanticide were
as stringent as our own, but they were often successfully
evaded. Poverty was so grinding in the East that the
slaughter of children was one of its most pitiable consequences.
Infants were made way with at birth, before
they were regarded with the eye of affection.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago slavery was prevalent among the Chinese,
and one of its saddest features consisted in the fact
that its victims were of their own race and color. Poverty-stricken
parents sold their offspring to brokers, and in
Foo Chow it was recognized as a legitimate business.
Theoretically there were no slaves in Hong-Kong, which
is British territory, but in reality the city was full of
them. Both men and women slave-brokers infested the
large cities of China, and boys and girls between the ages
of ten and twelve were sent from all the neighboring villages
to be sold in Foo Chow. The girls were purchased
to be employed as servants, and sometimes parents would
buy them for the purpose of training them until they
reached the proper age and of then marrying them off to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
their sons. In this way, as may readily be seen, some of
the young people of China were spared the vicissitudes
and discouragements of courtship so keenly realized in
some other countries. I have seen girl slaves sold with
no other property except the clothes upon their backs.
Frequently their garments were of the scantiest character
and in some cases even these were claimed by the
avaricious brokers. Many of the waifs were purchased
upon trial as a precaution against leprosy which prevailed
throughout the East. One of the tests consisted in placing
the child in a dark room under a blue light; if the
skin was found to be of a greenish hue, the slave passed
muster; but, on the other hand, if it was of a reddish tinge
it indicated the early stages of this fatal malady. Babies
were not much in demand in Foo Chow and did not even
command the price of fresh pork! I learned at an orphan
asylum in Shanghai that they were purchased at
twenty cents each. This institution was conducted by
missionaries who taught the girls all kinds of domestic
duties and, when they arrived at proper ages, saw that
they were given to suitable men for wives.</p>

<p>Not far from the Consulate were the quarters of the
Tartars. They seemed to live very much to themselves,
and most of the men were connected with the military
service of the country. It may not be generally known
that ever since the commencement of the Tartar dynasty,
between two and three centuries ago, the queue has been
worn by the Chinese as a badge of submission to the Tartars.
The feet of the women were not compressed by
these early rulers and consequently the Court did not set
the fashion as in European countries. I understand that
even now the bandaged feet are universal.</p>

<p>In those days there were no railroads or telegraphs in
China. The Emperor died while we were living in Foo
Chow and the news did not reach us until several weeks
after the event, and then only through the medium of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
courier. The official announcement came to the Consulate
upon a long yellow card bearing certain Chinese characters.
All of the mandarins in our city, upon receiving
the intelligence, gathered at the various temples to bewail
in loud tones and with tearful eyes the death of their
ruler.</p>

<p>The palace of the Viceroy was naturally the chief objective
point of all foreigners and especially of officials
upon their arrival in port. Occasions frequently occurred
when Mr. Gouverneur was compelled to go through
the formality of requesting an interview with this high official.
These audiences were always promptly granted
and were conducted with a great amount of pomp and
ceremony very dear to the inhabitants of "far Cathay,"
but exceedingly tiresome to others. Some distance from
us, and in another quarter of the city, was a large building
called Examination Hall, used by the natives exclusively
in connection with the civil service of the government.
It was divided into small rooms, each of which
was large enough to accommodate only one person, and in
these the young men of that locality who were aspirants
for governmental positions were locked each year while
they wrote their test examination papers. The hall accommodated
ten thousand students and the time of examination
was regarded by the Chinese as a critical period
in a young man's life, as his chances of future success
largely depended upon the ability displayed in his papers.
These were carefully read by a board of examiners, and
official positions were assigned to those who excelled in
the examination. Intelligence was regarded as the chief
condition of executive favor and, although personal influence
naturally had its weight, its exercise did not seem to
be as prevalent in China as elsewhere. It may not be
flattering to the pride of other nations, but the fact remains
that the civil service of China was the forerunner
of the reforms instituted in countries which we are accus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>tomed
to regard as much more enlightened in governmental
polity.</p>

<p>While we were in China, the seas were infested with a
formidable band of native pirates that had committed
depredations for many years. One day two rival factions
dropped anchor at the same time in the Min River, directly
opposite Foo Chow, and opened a brisk fire upon
each other. Many of the foreigners became much alarmed,
as projectiles were flying around at a lively rate. One
of these which had entered the house of an American missionary
was brought to the Consulate, and Mr. Gouverneur
was urged to take some action. The natives of China
were at times a turbulent people who seemed glad for an
excuse to stir up the community and, in consequence of
this battle of the sea-robbers, a mob formed in Foo Chow
which threatened disastrous results. The only foreign
vessel in the harbor was a United States man-of-war, the
<i>Adams</i>, under the command of James F. Schenck, subsequently
a Rear Admiral in our Navy. Only a few
days previous the British ships had departed for the
mouth of the Peiho River, for the purpose of forcing
opium upon the poor Chinese at the cannon's mouth.
The city authorities were requested to use their influence
in quelling the riots but seemed unequal to the emergency.
This state of affairs continued for several days, when one
morning the <i>Taotai</i> (mayor), preceded by men beating
gongs and followed by a large retinue, arrived at the Consulate
and requested protection for the city. Upon a similar
occasion during the previous summer, when a number
of British warships were in port, these belligerent
pirates received summary treatment by having their anchor
cables cut, thus causing them to float down the river.</p>

<p>Upon Mr. Gouverneur's request the <i>Adams</i> sent a detachment
of marines on shore. It was quartered around
the Consulate and its presence quickly had the desired
moral effect upon all parties, and proved a source<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of great relief to both foreign and native residents.
Later all apprehension was removed by the speedy departure
of the unwelcome marauders. Meanwhile the Consulate
had received many valuables, deposited there for
safety. The morning following the departure of the ships
we noticed a large number of boxes in our courtyard and
also several sheep tied to the flag-staff. For a time we
could not understand the meaning of this queer collection
and were compelled to assign it to the usual incomprehensibilities
of Chinese life. Mr. Gouverneur went in
search of our interpreter, hoping that he could explain
the situation, but to our surprise he had fled. We learned
that he stood in great awe of the pirates and feared their
vengeance if he told all he knew about them. Mr. Milne,
the British interpreter, finally came to our rescue. It
seems that the sheep and boxes were parting gifts&mdash;"Kumshaws,"
as the Chinese term them&mdash;from the pirates
to the American and British Consuls and Mr. Milne.</p>

<p>At first we had no idea what the boxes contained, and
Mr. Gouverneur sought the advice of William Sloane, the
head of the <i>Hong</i> of Russell and Company, who had
long been a resident of China, as to what should be done
with this strange consignment. He strongly urged that,
as a matter of policy, they be accepted and the British
Consul, Walter H. Medhurst, agreed with him. The medley
collection was accordingly divided into three groups
and some coolies were engaged to convey to the English
Consul and Mr. Milne their respective shares. The sheep
took the lead, and it was indeed a curious procession that
we watched from our windows as we breathed a sigh of
relief over the departure of this "embarrassment of
riches," and commenced to plan for the disposal of our
own share. A few minutes later I chanced to glance out
of the window when, to my utter dismay, I saw the procession
so recently <i>en route</i> to the British Consulate reenter
our courtyard. We were informed that Medhurst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
had weakened and refused to receive his share of the
"Kumshaws." Mr. Gouverneur was much annoyed by
such vacillating conduct and immediately notified the
British Consul in emphatic language that if he refused to
accept the piratical gifts he would regard it as a personal
matter. This had the desired effect and a second time
the procession wended its way to the British Consulate.
The boxes proved to contain hams, rock candy, dates and
other provisions which we immediately sent to the American
missionaries, while the sheep were given to Mr. Sloane
to do with them whatever he pleased. We found this
gentleman throughout our Chinese life to be a man of superior
judgment and an agreeable companion. After a
long and successful career in the East, he died in China
just on the eve of his embarkation for America. He never
married and many years later I had the pleasure of becoming
acquainted with his brother, Samuel Sloane, the
railroad magnate, at Garrison's-on-the-Hudson; and,
owing to our agreeable association with his brother, both
Mr. and Mrs. Sloane always welcomed me with great
cordiality.</p>

<p>I have already referred to Commander (afterwards Rear
Admiral) James F. Schenck, U.S.N. Our association
with him in Foo Chow was highly agreeable. He was our
frequent guest at the Consulate and we soon discovered in
him a man of rare wit; indeed, I have understood that
fifty years ago he was considered the most clever <i>raconteur</i>
in the Navy. Commander Schenck's Executive Officer
on the <i>Adams</i> was Lieutenant James J. Waddell,
whom we regarded as a pleasing and congenial guest.
Subsequent to his life in Eastern waters, his career was
unusually interesting. He was a native of North Carolina
and, resigning his commission in the United States
service at the opening of the Civil War, subsequently entered
the Confederate Navy, where he was finally assigned
to the command of the celebrated cruiser <i>Shenandoah</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
This ship, formerly the British merchantman <i>Sea King</i>,
was bought in England for &pound;45,000 by James D. Bulloch,
the Naval Agent of the Southern Confederacy in Great
Britain, to take the place of the <i>Alabama</i>, which had been
sunk by the <i>Kearsarge</i> in June, 1864. She left London
in the fall of the same year and fitted out as an armed
cruiser off Madeira. She then went to Australia and,
after cruising in various parts of the Pacific, sailed for
Behring Sea and the Arctic Ocean, where she met with
remarkable success in her depredations upon Northern
shipping. She captured thirty-eight vessels, mostly whalers,
and the actual losses inflicted by her were only sixty
thousand dollars less than those charged to the <i>Alabama</i>.
Captain Waddell first heard of the downfall of the Confederacy
when off the coast of Lower California on the
2d of August, 1865&mdash;between three and four months after
the event&mdash;and, as he had captured in that interval about
a dozen ships and realized that his acts might be regarded
as piratical, he sailed for England where, early in November,
he surrendered the <i>Shenandoah</i> to the British
government. She was turned over to the United States,
was subsequently sold to the Sultan of Zanzibar and was
lost in 1879 in the Indian Ocean. She was the only ship
that carried the flag of the Confederacy around the world.
In December, 1861, Captain Waddell married a daughter
of James Iglehart of Annapolis, and died in that city a
number of years ago.</p>

<p>The American Consulate was the rendezvous of all
Naval officers who came into port, and I recall with gratification
Lieutenant John J. B. Walbach, a son of Colonel
John DeBarth Walbach, a well-known officer of the Army,
Dr. Philip Lansdale, Dr. Benjamin F. Gibbs, Lieutenant
George M. Blodgett and Lieutenant (afterwards Rear
Admiral) John C. Beaumont. The latter was frequently
my guest in Washington after my return to America, and
Doctors Lansdale and Gibbs I met again at the Capital,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
where we took pleasure in discussing our Chinese observations
and experiences. While in China I also became acquainted
with Captain and Mrs. Eliphalet Nott of Schenectady,
the former of whom was a nephew of the venerable
President Eliphalet Nott of Union College. He commanded
his own vessel, the <i>Don Quixote</i>, and was usually
accompanied on his voyages by his wife&mdash;a mode of life
that impressed me as quite ideal.</p>

<p>One day as I was passing through the streets of Foo
Chow my attention was directed to a gayly-dressed woman
seated in a chair decked with flowers. I was informed
that she was a Chinese widow who was about to sacrifice
herself upon the pyre in accordance with the custom of
the country. I subsequently learned that when this
woman reached the place appointed for the ceremony, she
found an immense assemblage, including many mandarins
and her own brother, the latter of whom had agreed to
apply the torch that should launch her into eternity.
The crowd, however, was disappointed, for at the last moment
her courage failed her and she announced that she
must return home at once as she had forgotten to feed
her pig! The woman's life was saved, but the disappointment
of the throng found expression in a riot which,
however, was speedily quelled by the authorities.</p>

<p>The Chinese nation was the victim of an outrageous
wrong, and the perpetrators were Americans and Englishmen
whose unquenchable avarice overcame their moral
convictions. I refer to the iniquitous manner in which
opium was introduced into the country and subsequently
sold to the natives. Large fortunes were accumulated in
this way, but it was nothing more nor less than "blood
money" wrung from the pockets of those who had a right
to expect better things from the representatives of
Christian countries. China at this time was unable to
cope by force with the Western nations, but she did not
renounce the right to protect herself from this outrage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
without a struggle. When, however, she asserted this
right, as she did on a certain occasion by seizing and burning
the deadly drug, she made herself liable for heavy indemnities
and was compelled to abandon the unequal struggle.
In consequence of this act, six hundred thousand dollars
passed through Mr. Gouverneur's hands as U.S. Consul.
Even in recent years the Chinese Emperor has sought
to protect his subjects from the evils of opium. When I
lived in China, Congo tea was cultivated around Foo
Chow, but in time it was abandoned and the poppy took
its place. A few years ago an edict was issued prohibiting
the cultivation of this flower and I understand that tea
is again a product of this region. When I resided in
Foo Chow, some of the most prominent business houses
were involved in the smuggling of opium, and one very
large and wealthy firm&mdash;that of Jardine and Matthewson&mdash;actually
employed a heavily armed gunboat to assist
it in the accomplishment of this colossal outrage. It will
be remembered that when Li Hung Chang, then one of
the richest men in the world, visited this country a few
years ago he frequently asked the wealthy men whom
he met where they got their money. Whether or not he
had in mind at the time the manner in which certain
American and English fortunes had been accumulated in
his native land does not appear; but if his question had
been directed to the heads of some of the business houses
in Foo Chow and elsewhere in China while I was there,
it certainly would have produced, to say the least, no little
embarrassment.</p>

<p>Poor China has suffered much from the impositions and
depredations of foreigners. Pillage and theft have
marked the paths of foreign invaders in a manner wholly
inconsistent with the code of honorable warfare, and acts
have been committed that would never be tolerated in
conflicts between Western nations. It was said that the
title of Comte de Pelikao was conferred by Louis Napo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>leon
upon General Charles Montauban for having presented
the Empress Eug&eacute;nie with some superb black
pearls taken from the Imperial Summer Palace when it
was looted in 1860. At the same time and in the same
manner also disappeared many almost priceless gems,
costly articles of <i>vertu</i>, treasures in gold and silver and a
wealth of ancient manuscripts; while similar outrages
were ruthlessly perpetrated in the same unfortunate city
only a few years ago as the closing chapter in the Boxer
troubles. Unhappy China! She has felt the aggressive
hand of her Western "brothers" ever since the unwilling
invasion of her shores.</p>

<p>About this time China was the resort of many adventurous
Americans, some of whom doubtless "left their
country for their country's good," with a view of seeking
their fortunes. We became very well acquainted with
a New Yorker named Augustus Joseph Francis Harrison,
a master of a craft sailing in Chinese waters. His early
life had been spent in Morrisania in New York, where
he had become familiar with the name of my husband's
relative, Gouverneur Morris, and was thus led to seek our
acquaintance. One day he came to the Consulate apparently
in ill health and told us he was in a serious condition.
It seems that he had employed an English physician
whose violent remedies had failed to benefit him
and had prompted him to declare that he had been mistaken
for a horse! He begged us for shelter and we accordingly
gave him a room and retained him at the Consulate
as our guest. We knew but little of medical
remedies, but we did the best for him we could, and in
due time were delighted to see that our patient was convalescing.
One day my husband and my daughter Maud
visited him in his room and, as a token of gratitude, he
presented to the little girl the "Pirates' God," one of his
most cherished treasures&mdash;a curious idol, which is still in
her possession. On the back of it he wrote the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
history:&mdash;"This idol, together with the whole contents of
two large pirate boats, was captured after a severe fight
of three hours, they having undertaken to take us by surprise;
consequently thirty or forty were killed. The rest
made good their escape by jumping overboard and swimming
ashore. The boats and contents, too, were sold."</p>

<p>Foo Chow was a region frequently visited by typhoons,
in consequence of which a municipal law required houses
to be but one story high. During the latter part of our
residence in China we experienced the terrors of a storm
remarkable for its severity and in the course of which a
portion of the Consulate was blown down. After spending
some anxious hours in an underground passage in the
middle of the night, we were finally obliged to take refuge
in the <i>Hong</i> of Augustus Heard and Company. I shall
never forget, as we sat in this lonely cellar with the elements
raging above us, the imploring cries of my young
children, "I want to go home." It was while this storm
was raging that Mr. Gouverneur received the following
note from George J. Weller, the representative of this
well-known firm:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My dear Mr. Gouverneur,</p>

<p>The Barometer is going up&mdash;the wind will probably
abate a little soon, and perhaps then Mrs. G. and the children
can come. <i>Make</i> the coolies carry the chair. Three
can do it.</p></div>

<p>The semi-tropical climate of Foo Chow, however, did not
agree with Mr. Gouverneur, in consequence of which we decided
to return home. His campaign during the Mexican
War had made serious inroads upon his health, from which
he never entirely recovered. It was hoped that his life in
the East would be beneficial, but it proved otherwise.
Meanwhile, the Civil War was raging in the United States,
but the news concerning it was very stale long before it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
reached us. We did not receive the particulars of the
battle of Bull Run, for example, until three months after
its occurrence. In view of the turbulent state of affairs
at home, the government thought it important that Mr.
Gouverneur should remain at his post of duty until the
arrival of his successor, and he decided to do so. During
these days of uncertainty, however, my husband deemed
it wise that, if possible, I should return with the children
on a ship sailing under the protection of the British flag,
and I quite agreed with him. In due time the favorable
opportunity presented itself, and I embarked for America
in the British merchantman <i>Mirage</i>. The wisdom of Mr.
Gouverneur's judgment was fully confirmed, as the next
American vessel sailing from Foo Chow after my departure
was captured by a Confederate privateer. When
I went to China I took two little girls with me, and returned
with three. At the birth of the last daughter we
named her "Rose de Chine," in order to identify her
more intimately with the land of her nativity. Soon
after her birth, several Chinese asked me: "How many
girls do you keep?"</p>

<p>We were the only passengers on the <i>Mirage</i> and, besides
having very superior accommodations on board, we
were treated with every consideration by its captain.
We were three months upon the homeward voyage and
the captain called it smooth sailing. We fell in with
many vessels <i>en route</i> and, to quote our skipper, we found
them "like human beings, some very friendly and others
stern and curt." When in mid-ocean we passed an American
vessel, the <i>Anna Decatur</i>, which seemed like a welcome
from home as it was named after a former New
York friend of mine, Anna Pine Decatur, a niece of Commodore
Stephen Decatur, who married Captain William H.
Parsons of the merchant service. Lieutenant Stephen Decatur,
U.S.N., a brother of Anna Pine Decatur, was a constant
visitor at our house in Houston Street in my young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
days. During one of his cruises he was stricken with a
serious illness which resulted in total blindness. He subsequently
married but, although he never had the pleasure
of seeing his wife and children, his genial nature was
not changed by his affliction. In 1869 he became a Commodore
on the retired list, but some of the family connection
objected to his use of this title, as in their opinion
the world should recognize only one Commodore
Stephen Decatur, the naval hero of 1812.</p>

<p>As we neared New York harbor I became decidedly
impatient and was congratulating myself one morning
that our long voyage was almost over, when I noticed
that the usually pleasant expression on the captain's
face had changed to one of extreme anxiety. I inquired:
"What is wrong, Captain?" and to my dismay he replied:
"Everything!" He then told me we were just
outside the pilot grounds, but that in all his experience,
even in Chinese waters, he had never known the barometer
to fall so low; and, to add to his anxiety, there was no
pilot within sight! It was a very cold February morning,
the thermometer having reached the zero mark, and
I went at once to my cabin to prepare for the worst.
The captain meanwhile commenced to make preparations
for a severe storm, but before we realized it the tempest
was upon us and our vessel was blown far out to sea,
where for three days we were at the mercy of the elements.
The rudder was tied, the hatches battened down
and there was nothing left to do but to sit with folded
hands and trust to that Providence whom even the
waters obey.</p>

<span class="caption">Mrs. Gouverneur&#39;s Three Daughters.<br /></span>
<span class='caption2'><i>Miss Gouverneur, Mrs. Roswell Randall Hoes, Mrs. William Crawford Johnson.</i></span>
</div>

<p>I remember sitting in my stateroom one of those terrible
nights entirely alone and without even the comforting
sound of a human voice. Our life preservers were
within reach, but I fully realized that they would be of
but little avail in such a raging sea. During those anxious
moments, with my little children sound asleep in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
adjoining cabin and quite oblivious of impending danger,
I wondered whether it would be my destiny to close my
earthly career on Rockaway Beach, near the spot where
I had first seen the light of day; but soon after those
anxious moments I was indeed grateful, as the captain
told me that if the wind had been in another quarter
all of us would have perished within a few hours.
Gradually the winds and storm ceased and, the waters
becoming calmer, we finally reached our haven without
even being subjected to the annoying presence of
a Custom House official, as the high seas had prevented
his visit. When I reached land I learned that the awful
storm had extended along the whole eastern coast and had
carried death and devastation in its track. The children
and I were driven to my mother's late residence, 57 West
Thirty-sixth Street, but she was no longer there to greet
me, as she had passed into the Great Beyond the year before
my return; but my sister Charlotte and my brother
Malcolm were still living there, both of whom were unmarried.
I had received such kindness from the captain
of the <i>Mirage</i> during the homeward voyage that I felt I
should like to make some fitting return, and accordingly
his wife and daughter became my guests.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE CIVIL WAR AND LIFE IN MARYLAND</h3>


<p>As the time passed I became somewhat anxious over
the delay in Mr. Gouverneur's return to this country.
It seems, however, that, with neither of us
knowing it, we were upon the sea at the same time. His
homeward voyage was made by the way of the Isthmus
of Suez and Marseilles. For a while it seemed difficult for
either of us to realize that we were in our own country
once more, as the Civil War had turned everything and
everybody topsy turvy. When we left the country, party
animosities were pitched to a high key, but the possibility
of a gigantic civil war as a solution of political problems
would have been regarded as preposterous. On our return,
however, the country was wild with excitement over
an armed struggle, the eventual magnitude of which no
one had yet dreamed of. Newly equipped regiments were
constantly passing in our vicinity for the seat of war, the
national ensign and other emblems of loyalty were displayed
on every hand and a martial spirit pervaded the
very atmosphere. The war was the one important topic
of conversation at homes, in the streets and in places of
business. The passions of the people were so thoroughly
aroused that they were frequently expressed in severe denunciation
of any who presumed to entertain conservative
views of the situation of affairs and who still hoped for
conciliation and peace. Suspicions were often created by
trivial but well-intended acts or remarks that were susceptible
of a double construction, and loyal sentiment was
often so pronounced in its denunciation of the South that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
no word or remark could be tolerated that by any possibility
could be construed as a criticism of the administration,
a disapproval of the war or of any detail relating
to its conduct. For example, not long after our return
from China, while Mr. Gouverneur and I were visiting
my sister, Mrs. Eames, in Washington, we were watching
one day a newly equipped regiment from Vermont while
passing her residence <i>en route</i> for the seat of war, when
Mr. Eames remarked, "Gouverneur, isn't that a fine regiment?"
My husband, who then and always thereafter
was thoroughly loyal to the cause of the Union, but whose
military training had made him familiar with the precise
tactics and evolutions of regular troops, replied: "They
need training," when Mr. Eames, with much warmth of
feeling, exclaimed: "You are a secessionist, sir!"</p>

<p>That, however, represented but a mild state of feeling
compared with that sometimes entertained between those
who were loyal to the Union and others who sympathized
with the South. I recall one conspicuous instance where
such antagonistic views resulted in personal animosity
that severed tender personal relations of long standing.
When I left the country a lifelong intimacy had existed
between Mrs. Charles Vanden Heuvel, a granddaughter
of Robert Morris, the great financier of the Revolution,
and Mrs. George Gibbs, granddaughter of the Connecticut
statesman, Oliver Wolcott; but after the outbreak of
the war these two elderly women differed so radically in
their views concerning the conflict that, for a period, their
personal relations were severed. The spirit of toleration
was so utterly lacking in both the North and the South
that even those allied by ties of blood were estranged, and
a spirit of bitter resentment and crimination everywhere
prevailed. This state of feeling, under the circumstances,
was doubtless inevitable, but it emphasized better than
almost anything else, except bloodshed itself, the truth
of General Sherman's declaration that "War is Hell!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>The animosities engendered by the war ruptured family
ties and familiar associations in Maryland much more
completely than in the North. One of the Needwood families
was that of Outerbridge Horsey, who was a pronounced
Southern sympathizer, while not far away at
Mount O'Donnell, a superb old estate, lived General Columbus
O'Donnell, who ardently espoused the cause of the
Union. Mr. Horsey had a son born just after a Southern
victory whom he named Robert Victor Lee; but later,
after a Confederate defeat, General O'Donnell suggested
that the name be changed to Robert "Skedaddle" Lee,
whereupon Mr. Horsey retorted that he thought the name
of a grandchild of General O'Donnell might appropriately
be changed to George "Retreat" McClellan. Of Charles
Oliver O'Donnell, one of the General's sons, I retain the
pleasantest memories. He was a gentleman of attractive
personality and a genial nature. His first wife was Lucinia
de Sodr&eacute;, daughter of Luis Pereira de Sodr&eacute;, who at
the time of his daughter's marriage was the Brazilian
Minister in Washington. Mr. O'Donnell's second wife
was Miss Helen Sophia Carroll of Baltimore.</p>

<p>After remaining a few months in New York and a
shorter period in Washington, we visited Mr. Gouverneur's
father, who was still living at Needwood in Maryland.
Here we found a radical change of scene, for we
were now in close proximity to the seat of war. On our
journey southward we were somewhat delayed by the
rumor that General Lee was about to enter Maryland, rendering
it necessary for us to procure passes, which was
accomplished through the courtesy of General Edward
Shriver, a native of Frederick, who held at the time an
important official position in Baltimore. We had thought
when we arrived in New York that public feeling ran
high, but it was mild compared with our observations and
experiences in Maryland, and we never dared to predict
what a day would bring forth. Mr. Gouverneur's father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
was a pronounced Northern man, but his wife's relatives,
as well as most of his neighbors, sympathized with the
South. Soon after the outbreak of the war, while we
were yet in China, and at the period when Maryland
was wavering between the North and South, and to
anxious spectators secession seemed almost inevitable,
my father-in-law and ex-Governor Philip F. Thomas left
one morning on a hurried trip to Frederick, where the
State Legislature was convened in special session, instead
of at the State Capitol in Annapolis, which was then occupied
by Union troops. A report had reached them that
the legislature would probably declare for secession and
call a convention to take into consideration an ordinance
for the accomplishment of that end, and they desired to
exert whatever influence they could command to retain
the State in the Union. The national administration,
however, was equally alert, and a measure much more effective,
in this instance, than moral suasion was employed
to defeat the adherents of the Southern cause. General
John A. Dix arrested ten members-elect of the State Legislature,
the mayor of Baltimore, a congressman and two
editors; while in Frederick, General Nathaniel P. Banks
took into custody nine other members who, under the suspension
of the writ of habeas corpus, were confined for a
time either in Fort Lafayette in New York or in Fort
Warren in Boston. I well remember that one of these
was Severn Teackle Wallis of Baltimore, a lawyer of exceptional
prominence and ability and a universal favorite
in society.</p>

<p>Shortly before the battle of Gettysburg, when Frederick
County was occupied by the Union troops, many of
the officers dined at Needwood. A little later, although
over forty miles away, we knew that a great battle was
in progress, as we distinctly heard the steady firing of
heavy artillery. The news of the great Union victory
finally reached us and I listened in silent sympathy to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
rejoicing of the Unionists and heard the lamentations of
the sympathizers with the Southern cause.</p>

<p>After the battle of Gettysburg, the disorganized Southern
army came straggling along through Maryland, their
objective point being Harper's Ferry; while General
George G. Meade with his troops was on South Mountain,
within sight of the former locality. During the night
there arose one of the most violent storms I have ever
known, and we naturally supposed that it would render
the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, which meet at Harper's
Ferry, absolutely impassable, as all bridges had, of
course, been destroyed. The storm raged with such fury
that we were actually afraid to go to bed. Mr. Gouverneur
and I were elated because we believed it meant the
end of hostilities and the Union restored; for in our opinion,
it seemed impossible for human beings to successfully
contend with the elements and at the same time to live
under the fire of Meade's guns. It would therefore be
difficult to describe our surprise when we learned the next
morning that Lee's troops had safely crossed the Potomac
and were again on the soil of Virginia.</p>

<p>Several days later Mr. Gouverneur and I were driving
on the national turnpike, commonly called the Hagerstown
pike, when we encountered the Union army. Our
destination was the country seat of ex-Governor Philip
F. Thomas, two miles from Frederick and within the
shadow of Catoctin mountain, which we were contemplating
as a future home. Our travel was not impeded except
by an occasional inquiry in regard to our political sentiments,
as the Northern army was prone to believe that
every sojourner in Maryland at this time was an adherent
of the South. This national turnpike, which has been
and still is a well-traveled thoroughfare, was constructed
at a cost of several million dollars and was generally
regarded as an extravagance of John Adams' administration.
In speaking of this road, which begins at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Georgetown, D.C., and crosses the mountains into Kentucky,
Henry Clay once remarked that no one need go
abroad for scenery after viewing "the Valley of the
Shenandoah, Harper's Ferry, and the still more beautiful
Middletown valley."</p>

<p>We were so favorably impressed by the Thomas place
that we decided to purchase it and in a short time found
ourselves permanent residents of Frederick County, in
Maryland. We changed the name from "Waverley" to
"<i>Po-ne-sang</i>," which was the name of a Chinese Mission
and meant "a small hill." After seeing the children and
myself comfortably established in our new home, Mr. Gouverneur
felt that he was now free to give his services to the
country for which he had so valiantly fought during the
Mexican War. As he was still in exceedingly delicate
health, active service in the field with all the exposures of
camp life was entirely out of the question but, desirous
of rendering such services as he could, he wrote the following
letter to Major General Henry W. Halleck, Commander
in Chief of our Army:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On my return from China, where I held the office of
Consul of the U.S., in the early part of May last I had
the honor, through the Honorable Secretary of State, to
offer my services to the President of the United States in
any capacity in which my military or other experience
might enable me to serve my country in its present hour
of peril. To my communication to this effect I have received
no reply.</p>

<p>I have the honour now to tender to you my services on
your staff in some position wherein they may prove most
available.</p>

<p>The record of my former services in Mexico is on the
files of the War Department, and I am without vanity led
to believe that the historical associations which place my
name in connection with that of James Monroe may give
a prestige in our cause not wholly valueless. In conclu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>sion
I beg to add that the subject of compensation with
me would be a matter of indifference.</p></div>

<p>General Halleck replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>Washington, July 30, 1863.</p>

<p>Samuel L. Gouverneur Jr.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>The law authorizing the appointment of additional
aides has been repealed. Moreover, I have long since refused
to nominate except for distinguished or meritorious
military services. It is true that some have been put upon
my staff without having rendered any service at all, but
they were not nominated by me, and I do not recognize
their appointment as legal.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Yours &amp;c.,</p>

<p class='indent4'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">H. W. Halleck</span>,<br />
Major General Commanding.</p></div>

<p>General Halleck seemed to be ignorant of the fact that
the chief requisite for serving upon his staff was not wanting
in the case of my husband, who, as before stated, was
brevetted for gallantry and meritorious conduct at the
battles of Contreras and Churubusco in the Mexican War.</p>

<p>Halleck's reply was a bitter disappointment to Mr. Gouverneur
but a tremendous relief to me, as I knew he was
not in the condition of health to serve even as a staff-officer.
When he originally broached the subject to me I
did not try to dissuade him, as I felt that I had no moral
right to interfere with his ideas of duty to his country.
The Halleck letter, therefore, brought about a state of affairs
in our household much more satisfactory than my
most sanguine anticipations. Mr. Gouverneur, having
done his full duty, gave up his idea of re-entering the
Army and, in a spirit of contentment, began to take up
life in our new home.</p>

<p>During the month of August, 1863, we had just gotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
fairly settled when the Confederate guerrilla chieftain,
John S. Mosby, appeared at our door with his band of
marauders. Their visit was brief and we were spared the
usual depredations&mdash;why, we knew not, unless it were
owing to the fact that Mr. Gouverneur's nephew, James
Monroe Heiskell, a mere boy of sixteen, who ran away
from home and swam across the Potomac to join Mosby's
band, possibly accompanied him. Mosby's men in the
East and Morgan's rangers in the West represented a
species of ignoble warfare. In reality they did not benefit
the cause which they professed to serve, but merely
molested inoffensive farmers by carrying off their stock
and thus depriving them of their means of livelihood. In
recent years I discussed with a Confederate officer, the
late General Beverly Robertson, Mosby's mode of warfare,
and he surprised but gratified me very much by saying
that in his opinion, it was a great injury to the Southern
cause. It seems hardly just that, during President Grant's
administration and later, official positions should have been
bestowed upon Mosby while the interests of other Confederate
officers who had fought a fair and honorable
fight and had battled, moreover, for their country during
the Mexican War, should have been neglected.</p>

<p>These war experiences furnished strenuous days for us
in our new home and we lived in a state of constant excitement.
I well recall the first morning it was announced
to us by one of the colored servants, while we
were at the breakfast table, that "the rebels were coming,"
and the feeling of timidity that nearly overpowered
me. Very soon some troops under the command of General
Bradley T. Johnson, a native of Frederick, marched
upon our lawn and encamped all around us. General
Johnson immediately came to our door and, although I
was in anything but a comfortable frame of mind, I summoned
all my courage and met him at the threshold. In
a very courtly manner&mdash;too much so, in fact, to be ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>pected
in time of war&mdash;he remarked, "You are a stranger
here, madam." I responded: "My life here has been
short; my name is Gouverneur." He at once said: "I
suppose you are a relative of Mr. Gouverneur of the Maryland
Tract." I admitted the fact although I was not quite
sure it was discreet to do so, as the Union sentiments of
my father-in-law were generally well known, and I was
talking to a Confederate General. He and his officers
spent some time with us and we found them exceedingly
friendly, and thus, at least for a time, the terrors of war
were averted. Many years later I met General Johnson
in my own drawing-room when he and his wife came from
Baltimore to attend the wedding of my daughter, Ruth
Monroe, to his cousin, Doctor William Crawford Johnson,
of Frederick. We naturally discussed our first meeting
when he was greeted with less cordiality than he received
during his present visit.</p>

<p>Upon learning of the approach of the Confederates, we
made rapid preparations for their advent. As we had
learned from our neighbors that the South stood in great
need of horses and we owned a number of them of more
than usual value, Mr. Gouverneur seized upon an ingenious
plan for concealing them. Under our house was
a fine cellar which, unfortunately, the horses refused to
enter until the steps leading into it were removed. When
this had been done, they were led down one by one into
a darkened room, and bags were securely tied over their
eyes to prevent them from neighing. During the visit of
the Confederates, which seemed to us interminably long,
owing to our anxiety about the horses, General Johnson
sat directly over their hiding place; but they behaved like
well-bred beasts and never uttered a sound. I had serious
misgivings, however, when I saw a mounted officer, riding
around the house to make a survey of the premises, stop
at the upturned steps. For a moment I thought all was
over and my feelings were akin to those, I fancy, of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
person secreting stolen goods; but the investigation happily
went no further and he rode on.</p>

<p>When the active preparations for hiding the horses were
in progress my children were running hither and thither
and watching the process with much interest and excitement.
I called them to me and in my sternest tones told
them of the near approach of the soldiers and gave them
to understand that if they said "horse" or "rebel devil"
in their presence I should punish them severely. They
had been taught by the negroes on the place to call the
Southerners "rebel devils," and I feared for the result if
they allowed their childish tongues to wag too freely. A
few hours later I spoke to one of the little girls upon some
topic entirely foreign to our original subject, but she was
so overawed by my threat and the presence of the troops
that she seemed afraid to utter a word. After a little
encouragement, however, she crept up to my side and
whispered: "Mamma, they have taken all of our saddles!"
General Johnson was still sitting on our porch, when a
soldier approached and asked for an ax. One was immediately
procured, when the General, asking the man's
name, said: "That ax is to be returned." This order
struck me as somewhat ludicrous when a little later I
learned that the ax was to be used in demolishing all of
our fences! This precaution was deemed important in
order to facilitate, if necessary, a more speedy retreat.</p>

<p>As night approached we were asked if a guard would
be acceptable, and we were only too glad to avail ourselves
of such protection. As we were closing the house
for the night, after our strenuous day, one of the soldiers
on guard duty remarked to me, in a friendly voice: "Now
I am going to bed!" In my astonishment I said:
"Where?" The smiling response was: "On the porch,
to be sure!" In this state of unrest there was no repose
for us that night and we did not even attempt to undress,
as we knew not what an hour might bring forth. Just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
before dawn there was a knock upon the front door and,
upon opening it, I found facing me a guard who, without
any apology, said: "I left my boots inside!" Before I
had locked the front door again and returned to my room,
the Southerners had "folded up their tents like the Arabs
and as silently stolen away." Only a short period had
elapsed when several mounted officers dashed up our
driveway and anxiously inquired: "Where are the
guards?" They gave me only time enough to say,
"They have gone," when they rode rapidly away. We
came to the conclusion that they were young men visiting
their relatives and friends in Frederick and that the retreat
was so sudden that no word of warning could be
sent them.</p>

<p>We realized the next day that the hasty departure of
the Confederates was timely, as the Union Army was encamped
all around us. Some of the officers came to see
us and Mr. Gouverneur invited them to dine. This was
a period of sudden transitions, for that night the Union
Army retreated and the next day the Confederates were
with us again, dining upon the remnants of the meal left
by their adversaries. It was all we had to give them, as
all our colored servants, having been told that they would
be captured and taken further South, had fled upon hearing
of the second visit of the Confederates. This was
naturally a trying experience for me, as no servant except
a Chinese maid was left upon the place and I was in a
strange locality. But luckily I found the last set of officers
pleasant and congenial and ready to make due allowance
for all household deficiencies. Several of them
were natives of Loudoun County, Virginia, and were familiar
with our name, as they had lived near Oak Hill,
the estate of Mr. Gouverneur's grandfather, where my husband
had passed a portion of his early life. We soon learned
that country life during war times without satisfactory
servants was much more than either Mr. Gouverneur or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
I had sufficient courage or strength to bear. This state of
affairs resulted in my husband going to New York, where
he secured a family of Irish immigrants consisting of a
woman and three men. The relative positions of the two
armies in our general vicinity had meanwhile shifted several
times and we never knew from day to day whether
we were destined to greet friend or foe.</p>

<p>On the particular morning of which I am about to speak,
the Confederates were again with us. They were apparently
unacquainted with the topography of the surrounding
country and were naturally desirous of securing such
information as should enable them, in case of necessity,
to effect a speedy and secure retreat. We received an
early call from several of their officers who inquired the
way to the "Alms House Road." We had been so busily
engaged in trying to settle ourselves down under such adverse
circumstances that we knew actually nothing of the
surrounding country; and, when Mr. Gouverneur informed
our visitors of this fact, they looked at one another in
such a decidedly incredulous way as to convince us that
they thought we were withholding information. My husband
finally sent for John Demsey, one of our Irish immigrants,
who had driven considerably around the adjacent
country, and one of the officers in a rather offensive
manner renewed his query about the "Alms House Road."
To our chagrin, John's answer was, "I do not know;" and
Mr. Gouverneur, realizing that affairs were assuming a
rather serious aspect, said: "John, you do know; tell the
officer at once." With true Irish perspicacity he exclaimed:
"Oh, sir, you mean the 'Poor House road'&mdash;I
know that;" and forthwith gave the desired information.
In anything but pleasant tones the Irish youth was told
by the officers to accompany them as guide, and the order
was obeyed with both fear and alacrity. Mr. Gouverneur
then exacted from the commanding officer his word of honor
that the man be permitted to return, and remarked at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
same time, in an ironical manner, that if they continued
to tear down our fences and commit other depredations
we should all of us know the location of the Alms House.</p>

<p>At a much later period General Jubal A. Early's Army
passed our door <i>en route</i>, as at least he hoped, for Washington.
General John B. Gordon sent an orderly to our
house with his compliments to ask for a map of Frederick
County, which we were unable to supply. All through
the day the Southern troops continued to march by, until,
towards sunset, the rear of the last column halted in front
of our place. As we knew that a battle was imminent,
we awaited the result with beating hearts and anxious
hopes. When the firing of cannon began we know that
the battle of the Monocacy had begun and were truly
grateful that it was four miles away! The battle was
short and decisive and the Southern Army was repulsed.
The wounded soldiers were conveyed to Frederick, where
hospitals were improvised, and the dead were laid to rest
in Mount Olivet Cemetery, on the outskirts of the city.
Both Northern and Southern sympathizers became skilled
nurses and their gentle ministrations resulted in several
instances in romantic attachments. Among the young
physicians left in Frederick to attend the wounded soldiers
was Doctor Robert S. Weir, who subsequently became
distinguished as a surgeon in New York City. While
stationed at the hospital in Frederick, he met a daughter
of Robert G. McPherson, whom at the conclusion of the
war he married. Mrs. McPherson was Miss Milicent
Washington, who was a direct descendant of Colonel Samuel
Washington, a younger brother of George Washington,
and whose five wives are all interred in the graveyard
at the old family home, Harewood, in Jefferson County,
Virginia. Mrs. McPherson, one of whose ancestors was
Miss Ann Steptoe, who married Willoughby Allerton, was
also a niece of "Dolly" Madison.</p>

<p>Prior to the battle of the Monocacy I discovered that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
our house was again surrounded by quite a number of
Northern soldiers. This was an usual occurrence, to be
sure, but this time they were making such a careful
scrutiny of the premises that I was led to inquire of one
of them what object they had in view. To my utter dismay
I was informed that as our house was upon a hill
they had selected it as "a position," and that our safest
place was in the cellar. We soon realized the wisdom of
this retreat as shells began to fly around us from several
directions and with much rapidity. We spent the greater
part of the day underground, wondering all the while how
long our involuntary imprisonment would last, as these
dark and dismal quarters were naturally a great restraint
upon the children and exceedingly depressing to Mr. Gouverneur
and myself.</p>

<p>Although Northern in our sentiments, we sometimes
preferred the visits of the Confederates to those of their
adversaries, owing to the greater consideration which we
received from them. Upon the arrival of our own soldiers,
their first act was to search the house from garret
to cellar. At first I indignantly inquired their object
and was curtly informed that they were searching for
"concealed rebels." I gradually tolerated this mode
of procedure until one morning when we were routed
up at five o'clock, and then I protested. The Union
soldiers took it for granted that, owing to the locality
of our home, we were Southern sympathizers, and accordingly
at times seemed to do everything in their
power to make us uncomfortable. During those trying
days I frequently recalled the wise saying of Marechal
Villars, "Defend me from my friends, I can defend myself
from my enemies." We noticed, however, a great
difference in the conduct of the various detachments of
the Union Army with which we came in contact. We
always greeted the appearance of the 6th Army Corps with
much enthusiasm. It was composed of stalwart and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
sturdy veterans of the regular Army; and I trust its survivors
will accept my humble tribute of respect and esteem.
Very early in the morning of the day following
the departure of some members of this corps from <i>Po-ne-sang</i>
a private appeared at one of our rear doors and inquired
when the troops had departed. He had been indulging
in a sound sleep under one of the broken fences
and was wholly unconscious that his comrades had moved
away. He hesitated for some minutes as to the course he
should pursue and then hurried off toward Hagerstown.
We subsequently learned that he was shot at a point not
far distant and were impressed anew by the bloody horrors
attending our Civil War.</p>

<p>General David Hunter made frequent visits to Frederick
and his approach was regarded with terror by those
in sympathy with the Southern cause. It was he who
performed the unpleasant duty of sending persons suspected
of disloyalty further South, thereby often separating
families. Many of his victims were elderly people
and it is difficult for me at this late day to describe the
amount of distress these orders occasioned. I remember
one case particularly well, that of Dr. John Thomas
McGill, a practicing physician who, together with his
wife, was ordered to proceed immediately. Mrs. McGill
was in very delicate health and the fright caused
by such summary proceedings, which by the way were not
carried out, tremendous Union influences having been
brought to bear, resulted in death. Many years after the
war I attended a supper party at the home of Judge and
Mrs. John Ritchie, when the guests drifted into war reminiscences.
Dr. McGill was present and, as the conversation
progressed, he was so overcome by his emotion that
an apoplectic stroke was feared.</p>

<p>During the numerous visits of the Confederate army to
Frederick County, General "Joe" Johnston became a
great favorite and for some time made his headquarters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
in the city of Frederick. I learned from Colonel William
Richardson, a beloved citizen of that place, that the General
was especially solicitous concerning the welfare of
the men under his command. One day, for example, he
found one of his soldiers eating raw persimmons and at
once reproved him for partaking of such unsuitable food.
The soldier explained that he was adapting his stomach to
the character of his rations. Although we did not see
Stonewall Jackson's troops pass on their march to Frederick,
we were aware of their presence there. Barbara
Frietchie, whom Whittier has immortalized, lived in a
small house on West Patrick Street, adjoining Carroll
Creek, but whether she ever waved a Union flag as Stonewall
Jackson's men were passing is a question concerning
which opinions differ. Southern sympathizers deny
it, while persons of Northern sentiments living in Frederick
assert that the verses of the Quaker poet represent
the truth. At any rate, a woman with such a name
"lived and moved and had her being" in that city. She
was interred in the burying ground of the German Reformed
Church, and frequently pilgrimages are made to her
grave, over which floats a Union flag not far from where</p>

</div></div>

<p>I may state, in passing, that it was during the Civil
War that the word "shoddy" was coined. It was originally
used to designate a class of inferior goods intended
for use in the army from the sale of which many fortunes
were made. Later the word was employed to designate
those who used such goods; and thus, by extension, one
heard not only of "shoddy people," but also of "shoddy
parties," "shoddy clothes," and so on.</p>

<p>We heartily shared in the rejoicings of the North when
General Lee surrendered. In our country home we had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
lived in an actual condition of camp life so long that at
its conclusion I remarked to my husband in a jocular vein
that I was prepared for a life with the Comanches! We
restored our damaged fences, dug up our silver which had
been buried many months under a tree in the garden, and
Mr. Gouverneur began to turn his attention to agriculture.
Our farm was among the finest in Frederick County, which
is usually regarded as one of the garden spots of the country.
Our social relations had been entirely suspended, as
the distractions attending the war had kept us so actively
employed; but that was now a past episode and we began
making pleasant acquaintances from Frederick and the
surrounding country. Among our first visitors were
Judge and Mrs. William P. Maulsby; Richard M. Potts and
his brother, George Potts; Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Trail;
the Rev. Dr. and Mrs. George Diehl and their daughter
Marie, who in subsequent years endeared herself to the
residents of Frederick; Mrs. John McPherson and her
daughter, Mrs. Worthington Ross; Dr. and Mrs. Fairfax
Schley; Judge and Mrs. John Ritchie; Mr. and Mrs. Jacob
M. Kunkel; and the Rev. Marmaduke Dillon-Lee, an Englishman
who had served in the British Army and at this
time was the rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in
Frederick. He had been selected for this pulpit on account
of his neutral political views and we found in him a
congenial acquaintance. He remained in Frederick, however,
for only a short period after the war and was succeeded
by the deservedly beloved Rev. Dr. Osborne Ingle,
who, after a pastorate of nearly half a century, recently
passed to his reward. I can not pass this Godly man by
without an encomium to his memory. He came to Frederick
as a very young man and throughout his long rectorship
he was truly a leader of his flock and, like the
"Good Shepherd of Old," the sheep knew him and loved
him.</p>

<p>It did not take long for Mr. Gouverneur and me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
discover that neither of us was adapted to a country life
under the conditions prevailing at the close of the War&mdash;so
very different from those existing in that locality at a
later period. He knew nothing of practical farming and
I knew nothing of practical cooking. Although I was
never entirely without domestic service, as I always had
with me the Chinese maid whom I had brought from the
East, we were not fitted, at the best, for such a life. The
result was that after one winter's experience we made
<i>Po-ne-sang</i> only our summer home. During the trials
and tribulations of that distant winter I often recalled a
remark which Lord Chesterfield is said to have made to
several persons whom he disliked: "I wish you were married
and settled in the country." It has even been asserted
that, in his absentmindedness and excitement incident
to encountering an infuriated cow, he addressed
the beast with the same words. This was a favorite anecdote
of General Scott, and it appealed to me then as
well as now, as I regard country life a forlorn fate for
all women excepting possibly those who are endowed with
large wealth with which to gratify every passing whim.</p>

<p>The primitive life we led at <i>Po-ne-sang</i> was full of annoyances
and discouragements. For example, we had no
running water in our house and were supposed to supply
ourselves from a cistern in the yard which had contracted
the bad habit of running dry and for inconvenient periods
remaining so. We were therefore compelled to carry
all our water from a neighbor's spring at least a quarter
of a mile away. We tried to remedy this defect by boring
an artesian well, but all our attempts were unsuccessful.
Country life was distasteful to cooks as they preferred
to live in a city where they could make and mingle
with friends, and I soon learned that if I wanted to keep
a servant I must hire one who had a baby, and that is
just what I did. Although country life was distasteful
to her, too, she took her dose of medicine because she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
could not help herself as no one else would employ her.
Often these babies were a source of great care to me, as
their mothers would neglect them&mdash;sometimes from ignorance
but more frequently from sheer indifference. I
remember one cook whose baby, owing to the lack of
proper attention, was actually in danger of starving to
death. She kept it in a wooden box under a tree in the
garden, and I was obliged at stated intervals to see that
the child was fed.</p>

<p>During our summers at <i>Po-ne-sang</i> our servants made
both hard and soft soap in a large kettle which swung
from an iron tripod in the yard. They also made apple
and peach butter, a German marmalade that was highly
regarded in that section of the country. The apples or
peaches were allowed to cook slowly all day in a kettle
suspended from the tripod and were stirred by wooden
paddles, whose handles were long enough to enable them
to be worked at a convenient distance from the fire. In
making this marmalade, cider was regarded as an important
ingredient and the sugar was seldom added until
the last. Mr. Gouverneur experimented somewhat in wine
making. His success was almost phenomenal and we enjoyed
the fruits of his labor for many years. He used
Catawba grapes entirely, which were brought to our door
in wagon-loads by the country folk who surrounded us.</p>

<p>The Maryland mountaineers, as I knew them, were very
similar in life and character to those in North Carolina,
of whom more or less has been written the last few years.
They had peculiar customs as well as quaint modes of action
and expression, and invented names for things and
conditions to suit themselves. I remember, for example,
that when persons showed signs of physical illness and
the exact nature of their maladies was uncertain they
were said to have "the gobacks." Frederick County was
settled by the early Germans and many of their expressions
are still in vogue. A peach dried whole with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
seed retained is called a <i>hutzel</i>, and dried apples are
<i>snitz</i>. In this connection I am reminded of a German
family named House, which resided in Frederick and consisted
of four maiden sisters. Their means were limited
and they eked out their living by stamping from original
designs and taking in plain sewing. Their front door
was always locked and bolted, and to reach the inmates it
was necessary to pass through a gate leading into a long
alley and thence through a scrupulously clean kitchen and
up the steep and narrow back stairs to a small rear room,
where sat these four spinsters. The first one who met you
said, "Good-morning," and the others repeated the salutation
in turn until the last one was reached, who simply
said, "Morning." This laughable procedure was followed
in their subsequent conversation, for one of them had only
to lead off with a remark and the others repeated the close
of it. It is said that Crissie, the youngest of the quartette,
once had a beau with whom she sat each night for
many years in their prim parlor and that, when he finally
jilted her, one of her sisters was heard to remark, <i>&agrave;propos</i>
of the broken engagement: "Just think of all them candles
wasted!"</p>

<p>The second winter of our Maryland life was spent at a
hotel in Frederick where we formed a lasting friendship
with our fellow boarders, Judge and Mrs. John A. Lynch.
With my historical as well as social tastes, I found the
McPherson household a source of great pleasure and intellectual
profit to me. I knew Mrs. "Fanny" McPherson,
as she was invariably called, only as an elderly
woman who retained all the graces and charms of youth.
To listen to her tales of bygone days was a pleasure upon
which I even yet delight to dwell. She lived to a very
great age surrounded by her children, her grandchildren
and her great-grandchildren, and went to her grave beloved
by all. She was the granddaughter of Thomas Johnson,
the first Governor of Maryland. I remember read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>ing
on one occasion a letter which she took great pride in
showing me, written to her grandfather by Washington,
offering him the position of Secretary of State in his cabinet.
This flattering offer he declined, but to him is said
to belong the honor of having nominated Washington as
Commander in Chief of the Army.</p>

<p>Mrs. McPherson was nearly related to Mrs. John Quincy
Adams, who was Louisa Catharine Johnson of this same
Maryland family, and, as she was an occasional visitor at
the White House during her relative's residence there, she
mingled with many prominent people. I recall a weird
story she once told me in connection with a daughter of
Smith Thompson, Secretary of the Navy under President
Monroe. It seems she married the Viscount Paul Alfred
de Bresson, the third Secretary of the French Embassy
in Washington, and subsequently many elaborate entertainments
were given in her honor in Washington.
She returned with her husband to Europe and several
months later her family received the announcement of
her death. As they had only recently received a letter
from her, when apparently she was in the best of health
and spirits, they felt somewhat skeptical and wrote at
once for more definite information. A few weeks later a
package reached them containing her heart preserved in
alcohol. Mrs. McPherson's older daughter, Mrs. Worthington
Ross, lived with her mother and ministered with
loving hands to her wants in her old age, while the remainder
of her life was devoted to unselfish labor in her
Master's vineyard. Her memory, as well as that of her
only child, Fanny McPherson Ross, who passed onward
and upward before her, is still revered in Frederick.</p>

<p>Mr. Gouverneur and I also formed a pleasant acquaintance
with Rev. Dr. John McElroy, whose remarkable career
in the Catholic Church is well worthy of notice. Coming
to this country as a mere lad, he engaged in mercantile
pursuits in Georgetown, D.C., and when about sixteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
years of age became a lay Jesuit and in 1817 entered the
priesthood. After ministering to Trinity church in
Georgetown for several years, he was transferred, at the
request of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, to Frederick,
where he built St. John's church, a college, an academy,
an orphan asylum, and the first free school in the city.
After remaining there for twenty-three years and establishing
a reputation for devotion to his church and rare
executive ability that made him one of the most useful
Jesuits in the country, he was sent back to his old church
in Georgetown and the following year went to the Mexican
War as Chaplain in the regiment commanded by
Caleb Cushing. During our occasional conversations it
seemed to afford him more than usual pleasure to discuss
with me the ability of his distinguished military chief.
After the war he was sent to Boston, where he became
pastor of St. Mary's church, and built the Boston College
and the Church of the Immaculate Conception. At the
age of ninety, he became blind and retired to the scene
of his early labors in Frederick, where, as the oldest Jesuit
in the world, he died in the fall of 1877. I remember
meeting him one day on the street when he proudly
announced that it was his birthday and that he was
sixty-nine years of age. I knew him to be much older,
and my words of astonishment evidently revived his senses
for, realizing that he had reversed his figures, he corrected
himself by adding, "I mean ninety-six." At that
time he was quite active, considering his extreme age, and
to the close of his life was much respected and beloved
by the residents of Frederick, irrespective of creed. I
attended his funeral and he was laid to rest in the burying
ground of the old Novitiate which he founded. It
was then that I saw for the first time the grave of Chief
Justice Roger B. Taney. The two-story brick house in
Frederick in which he lived is still standing, but it would
be regarded with contempt by any of the present Justices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
of the Supreme Court of the United States. But how
natural, for how changed are the times! In an eloquent
address subsequent to Taney's death, Charles O'Conor
concluded with these words: "May the future historian
in writing of Judge Roger B. Taney sorrowfully add,
<i>Ultimus Romanorum</i>."</p>

<p>Francis Scott Key, the author of "The Star-Spangled
Banner," is also buried in Frederick soil. For many
years his remains reposed in an unnoticed grave in Mount
Olivet Cemetery but, through the efforts of the citizens of
Frederick, and especially of its women, an imposing monument
now towers above him surmounted by a superb male
figure with outstretched arms. While living in Maryland
I frequently met Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase at the
residence of Mrs. Margaret Goldsborough, and was much
impressed by his imposing presence and courtly bearing.
Many years before, he had been a tutor in the Frederick
College, which still survives and whose walls bear the inscription
"1797." Mrs. Goldsborough was a lifelong resident
of Frederick and a woman of a high degree of intelligence.
Her daughter, Miss Mary Catharine Goldsborough,
I always numbered among my most cherished
friends.</p>

<p>After a pleasant sojourn of a number of months in
Frederick, we went to spend the summer at <i>Po-ne-sang</i>,
where we had the satisfaction of entertaining quite a number
of old friends, among whom was the Hon. Lafayette
S. Foster, then Vice-President <i>pro tempore</i> of the United
States. Maryland was a familiar as well as a cherished
State to him, as in early life he had been a tutor in Centerville
on the "Eastern Shore." Mr. Foster's visit was
decidedly uneventful to him, as he was there entirely unheralded
and without even a newspaper notice to announce
his coming and going.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>VISIT TO THE FAR SOUTH AND RETURN TO
WASHINGTON</h3>


<p>In the autumn of the same year I decided to make a
long anticipated visit to Mrs. John Still Winthrop in
Tallahassee, whose marriage in Gramercy Park I
had attended so many years ago and which I have already
described. My two younger children accompanied me,
but my oldest daughter I left behind under her father's
protecting care at the Misses Vernon's boarding school in
Frederick. This period seemed especially suitable for
such a long absence, as the whole time and attention of
Mr. Gouverneur was engrossed in editing for publication
a posthumous work of James Monroe, which was subsequently
published by the Lippincotts under the title,
"The People the Sovereigns." We sailed from New York
and stopped <i>en route</i> in Savannah to enable me to see my
old friend and schoolmate, Mrs. William Neyle Habersham.
Sherman in his "March to the Sea" had passed
through Georgia, carrying with him destruction and devastation,
and the suffering which this and other campaigns
of the war had brought into the homes of these Southern
people it would be difficult to describe. The whole South
seemed to be shrouded in mourning, as nearly everyone
I met had given up to the "Lost Cause" a husband or
a son, and in some cases both. Two gallant sons of the
Habershams, mere boys, had died upon the same battlefield,
and when I saw Mr. Habersham for the first time
after the war he was so overcome with grief that he was
obliged to leave the room. Talented to an unusual degree
and possessing much fortitude, his wife fought bravely for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the sake of her dear ones still spared her, but every now
and then her sorrow asserted itself anew and seemed more
than her bleeding soul could bear. She was especially
gifted with her pen, and about ten years after the war,
while her heart was still wrung with grief, she wrote the
following pathetic lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Up above, the Pines make sweet music; sad, plaintive,
for must there not be a tone of "infinite sadness" in all
the places of Earth's finite gladness? From a spray of
jessamine I hear the chirp of a little bird&mdash;a young beginner;
it tries over and over again "its one plain passage of
few notes"&mdash;the prelude to the full-voice anthem which
summer will harmonize. Ah! what shades and sunlight!
what coloring! Green in the grass and trees, blue in the
violets and sky, gray in the moss, yellow in the jessamines,
falling around in a perfect Dan&aelig;an shower of burnished
gold! My truant fancy sees all this&mdash;and more! A dear
hand that held mine, a "pure hand," a boy's hand, that
ere many summers had spread out their gorgeous pageantry
had drawn the sword for that dear summer-land
of the jessamine and pine&mdash;had drawn the sword and
dropped it; dropped it from the earnest, vigorous clasp
of glorious young manhood to lie still and calm, life's
duty nobly done; ah, a short young life but ... and
then the other young soldier! for is not my sorrow a twin
sorrow? Can they be dissevered? In death they were
not divided. My eyes grow dim. Wipe away the mist,
poor mother! to see the dear faces of sons and daughters
gracing the board. Let the blue of the violets breathe to
thee rather of endless skies and an eternal Heaven, where
earth's finite sadness is beautified into infinite gladness.</p></div>

<p>We finally reached Tallahassee, where we found the
most cordial welcome awaiting us. Mrs. Winthrop lived
in the very heart of the city but our surroundings were
much more beautiful than I can describe, for the orange
trees and hyacinths and jessamine in full bloom and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
wealth of semi-tropical vegetation were suggestive of an
earthly Paradise. Since we last met my hostess had become
a widow, but fortunately she and her only son, who
was then just emerging into manhood, had not felt the
personal vicissitudes of the struggle, as they had taken
refuge in the mountains of North Carolina. Before the
war the Winthrops had owned hundreds of slaves and
most of them, in a state of freedom, were still living in
quarters only a short distance from the house and were
working on her plantations just as though the war had
not made them free. But both among those who suffered
from the war and those who escaped its ravages the unfriendly
feeling entertained at this time against their
Northern brethren was naturally intense. I remember
that one Sunday morning a young son of Mrs. Custis,
who with his mother was then an inmate of the Winthrop
household, asked his mother, who had just returned from
the early service of the Episcopal Church, whether "the
'Yankees' went up to the same communion table with the
Southern people."</p>

<p>During my Tallahassee life I made the acquaintance of
Madame Achill&eacute; Murat, who lived in an old mansion outside
of the city limits. She was Miss Catharine A. Willis
of Virginia, and a great-grandniece of General Washington.
Upon her marriage to Achill&eacute; Murat he took her abroad,
where she was received with much distinction on account
of her Washington blood. Then, too, her marriage into
such an illustrious French family was an open sesame
to the most exclusive circles of society. She was an elderly
woman when I met her, but her conversation
abounded with the most interesting reminiscences of her
life in France. She died in the summer of 1867.
Achill&eacute; Murat was the son of Joachim Murat, the great
Marshal of Napoleon, whose sister Caroline he married
and became King of Naples. Many years later his two
sons came to this country. One of them settled in Borden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>town
in New Jersey, and Achill&eacute; Murat, after his marriage
to his Virginia bride, became a resident of Florida.
Madame Murat told me of some of the visits she made to
France when the voyage was long and tedious. She had
many articles of <i>vertu</i> around her, and I especially recall
a superb marble bust by Canova of her mother-in-law,
Queen Caroline. I expressed surprise at the extreme attractiveness
of the late Queen, as I had always understood
that the Princess Pauline, Napoleon's other sister, was the
family beauty. Madame Murat, however, told me I was
mistaken and that her royal mother-in-law was, in that
respect, quite the equal of her sister.</p>

<p>During my acquaintance with Madame Murat, Napoleon
III. was on the throne of France, and I learned from
our many friendly chats that her relations with her distinguished
kinspeople were of the most cordial character;
and I am informed that for many years the Emperor gave
her an annuity. Hanging in her drawing-room, whose contents
were replete with historic association, were two handsome
portraits of the Emperor and Empress of France,
which she called to my attention as recent gifts from her
royal relatives. That prince of hosts, Gouverneur Kemble,
once told me an amusing incident <i>&agrave;propos</i> of Achill&eacute;
Murat's resourcefulness under peculiar difficulties. On
one occasion quite a number of foreign guests appeared at
the Frenchman's door and, although Florida is a land
"flowing with milk and honey," he was sorely perplexed
to know what would be "toothsome and succulent" to
serve for their repast. Suddenly an idea flashed upon
him. He owned a large flock of sheep and, nothing
daunted, gave immediate orders to have the tips of their
ears cut off. These were served in due form, and his
guests departed in total ignorance of what they had eaten
but fully convinced that America produced the choicest
of viands.</p>

<p>Upon one of her numerous visits to France, Madame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Murat was accompanied to the Louvre by Mr. Francis Porteus
Corbin, a Virginian whose contemporaries proudly asserted
was an adornment to any court. While they were
engaged in viewing the works of art, Madame Murat was
joined by Jerome Bonaparte, to whom she formally presented
Mr. Corbin. When the opportunity arose Bonaparte
inquired of his kinswoman who "the elegant gentleman"
was. The ready response was: "Mr. Corbin, of
Virginia." "Well," was the ejaculation, "I had no idea
there was so much elegance in America."</p>

<p>I think these pages will show that all through life I
have had a decided fancy for older men and women. I
can hardly account for this taste except by the fact that
my predilections have always been of a decidedly historical
character. As another instance, I especially enjoyed
my meeting in the far South with Judge Thomas Randall,
who made his home in Tallahassee, but who was originally
from Annapolis. He did not allow advanced years
to interfere with his social tastes, but frequently accompanied
us to parties, where his vivacity rendered him one
of the most acceptable of guests. Still another elderly
gentleman with whom I had the pleasure of becoming acquainted
during this Southern sojourn was Francis
Wayles Eppes. He was the son of U.S. Senator John
Wayles Eppes, whose wife was Maria Jefferson, elder
daughter of Thomas Jefferson. He left Virginia many
years prior to my acquaintance with him and settled with
several members of the Randolph family in Western
Florida when it was almost a wilderness.</p>

<p>I left with keen regret this picturesque land of flowers
and stately oaks, but duty called me home, as my husband
and little daughter were growing impatient over our long
absence. It would seem that the observance of timetables
differed in those days according to localities and
other circumstances. I was informed that the train I
should take from Tallahassee would leave <i>about</i> such and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
such a time; but upon my inquiring in Savannah as to
whether the ship upon which I proposed to embark for
Baltimore would leave on time, I was explicitly told by its
captain that if I were a minute late I should not be one
of its passengers.</p>

<p>After my return to Maryland, the home of our adoption,
we abandoned the idea of country life, sold our residence
and took up our abode in Frederick. My children
were now reaching an age when education became an important
matter and I took advantage of the Frederick
Female Seminary, an institution that has since become a
college, as an excellent place to which to send my eldest
daughter. It was during this period of transition that it
was my good fortune to meet for the first time the wife of
the Hon. Henry Gassaway Davis of West Virginia, who
was a native of Frederick and a daughter of Gideon
Bantz. Her two older daughters, Hallie, the widow of
U.S. Senator Stephen B. Elkins, and Kate, who subsequently
became the wife of Robert M. G. Brown of the
U.S. Navy, were boarding pupils at the same school; and
Mrs. Davis frequently visited them while there. My
daughters formed an intimate friendship with Mrs.
Brown, whom at a later day we often welcomed as a guest
in our Washington home. She has since passed "over the
river," having survived her mother for only a few months,
and her memory is hallowed in my family circle. Mrs.
Elkins, the promising young girl of so many years ago, is
widely known in Washington and elsewhere for her
womanly tact, intelligence and fine presence. Grace, another
of Mrs. Davis' daughters, is now Mrs. Arthur Lee
of Washington, but was born after my earlier acquaintance
with her mother in Frederick. Loved and admired,
she resides in Washington surrounded by an exclusive
coterie, and devotes much of her time and means to works
of philanthropy.</p>

<p>The prominent authoress, Mrs. Elizabeth F. Ellet, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
repeatedly our guest while we were living in Frederick.
A volume of her poems had appeared as early as 1835,
and she subsequently published quite a number of books
which were highly regarded. When she first came to
visit us, her "Women of the American Revolution" had
just appeared and her journey to Maryland was for the
purpose of collecting data for a new work which later was
published under the title of "The Court Circles of the
Republic." Besides being a gifted writer, Mrs. Ellet had
considerable histrionic ability, and I have now before me
an old newspaper clipping containing an account of an
entertainment given by me in her honor when she recited
from "Pickwick Papers", "Widow Bedott" and "The Lost
Heir." Another party at which music and recitations
were a prominent feature was given to Mrs. Ellet in Frederick
by Mrs. Charles E. Trail, a gifted woman who thoroughly
appreciated intellectual accomplishments wherever
found.</p>

<p>My first acquaintance with the Hon. Joseph Holt, who
at the time was Judge Advocate General of the Army, began
in Frederick in 1869. He was a Kentuckian by birth
and, after serving for a time as Postmaster General under
President Buchanan, succeeded, in 1860, John B. Floyd
of Virginia as Secretary of War. He made frequent
visits to Frederick where he was always the guest of the
Rev. Dr. and Mrs. George Diehl. He was a typical Kentuckian,
over six feet tall, and in my opinion no one could
have known him well without being impressed by his intellectual
ability. After we returned to Washington
to live, in 1873, Judge Holt was a constant visitor at our
home and I frequently attended handsome entertainments
given in his residence on Capitol Hill. Although I have
been in society more or less all of my life, I can say without
hesitancy that he more perfectly understood and practiced
the art of entertaining&mdash;it certainly <i>is</i> an art, and
possessed by but few&mdash;than any other person I have ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
known. His second wife, who was Miss Margaret Anderson
Wickliffe of Kentucky, had died in 1860 and, as he
had no children, he was living entirely alone.</p>

<p>From my earliest acquaintance with Judge Holt I was
deeply impressed by the cloud of sadness that seemed to
envelop him, and I never learned until I had known him
many years and really called him my friend that he was
laboring under a deep sense of wrong and injustice.
Without entering into exhaustive details, the main facts
are substantially these: In 1865 Mr. Holt was Judge Advocate
General of the Army and as such was the prosecuting
officer before the Military Commission convened by
order of President Johnson for the trial of Mrs. Mary E.
Surratt and others for complicity in the assassination of
Lincoln. The findings and sentence of the Commission were
accompanied by a recommendation signed by a majority
of its members in which they "respectfully pray the President,
in consideration of the sex and age of the said Mary
E. Surratt, if he can, upon all the facts in the case, find
it consistent with his sense of duty to the country, to
commute the sentence of death, which the Court have been
constrained to pronounce, to imprisonment in the penitentiary
for life." This recommendation for executive
clemency remained unknown to the public until it was incidentally
referred to by the Hon. Edwards Pierrepont,
counsel for the government in the trial of Mrs. Surratt's
son in 1867. This was followed in subsequent years, and
after Andrew Johnson had ceased to be President, by a
controversy in which reflections were made upon the personal
and official integrity of Judge Holt by the charge
that he had never presented the recommendation for
clemency to the President. The matter finally sifted itself
down to a question of personal veracity between the
ex-President and Judge Holt, in which the latter affirmed
that "he drew the President's attention specially to the
recommendation in favor of Mrs. Surratt, which he read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and freely commented on"; and was contradicted by the
ex-President in the assertion that "in acting upon her
case no recommendation for a commutation of her punishment
was mentioned or submitted to me."</p>

<p>The enemies of Holt accordingly held him indirectly
responsible for Mrs. Surratt's execution, and against such
a charge he naturally rebelled until the day of his death.
The most cruel feature of the whole affair, however, and
the one which probably did more than anything else to
sadden and becloud the remaining days of Judge Holt's
life, was the personal disloyalty of an eminent citizen
of his own State, who had been his intimate friend
from youth. I refer to James Speed, Andrew Johnson's
Attorney General. In 1883, after most of the prominent
actors in the scene were dead and the animosities caused
by the controversy were largely allayed&mdash;at a time, too,
when Holt realized that he was growing old and recognized
more keenly than ever the importance of leaving behind
a final refutation of the calumnies that had been
heaped upon him&mdash;he appealed to Speed, who, he believed
he had reason to assume was in possession of the exact
facts of the case; but all that could be wrung from him
were evasive words to the effect that he saw the petition
for clemency in the President's office, without intimating
whether it was before or after Mrs. Surratt's execution,
and that he did not "feel at liberty to speak of what was
said at cabinet meetings." An exchange of letters followed
between the two in which Speed excused himself for six
months on the pleas of bereavement and press of business,
and that he had lost his glasses, when he finally replied:&mdash;"After
very mature and deliberate consideration,
I have come to the conclusion that I cannot say more than
I have said." It is no wonder, then, that Holt, driven to
desperation by such treatment, wrote to Speed:&mdash;"Your
forbearance towards Andrew Johnson, of whose dishonorable
conduct you have been so well advised, is a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
mystery to me. With the stench of his baseness in your
nostrils you have been all tenderness for him, while for me ...
you have been as implacable as fate."</p>

<p>While spending the summer of 1888 in Princeton,
Massachusetts, I read in the <i>North American Review</i> for
July of the same year the correspondence relating to the
Surratt question between Holt and Speed in 1883. Knowing
Judge Holt as I did, having firm faith in his version
of the controversy, believing him to be a victim of gross
injustice and realizing withal how keenly through all
these years he had felt the sting of misrepresentation, I
wrote him a lengthy letter. It was not long before I received
his reply, and I copy it here, as I believe it casts
an additional sidelight upon a subject which caused this
brilliant and high-minded gentleman bitter suffering from
which he never wholly recovered. I add several more letters
written to me by him which are beautiful in expression
but pathetic in character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, August 26th, 1888.</p>

<p>Mrs. M. Gouverneur,</p>

<p>My dear Madam:</p>

<p>Your kind letter of the 14th instant was quite a surprise,
but a very agreeable one I assure you. My reply has been
thus long delayed from an impression that it would probably
more certainly reach your hands if addressed to you at
Frederick.</p>

<p>I have read and re-read your letter with increasing gratification
and thankfulness. Truly am I grateful for the
friendly spirit that prompted you to make so thorough an
examination of the Speed correspondence as your <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i>
of it discloses. That <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> is in every way admirable.
It has the clearness and logical force of a first-class lawyer's
brief. Indeed, I was on the point of asserting that
you have a good lawyer's head on your shoulders, but
prefer saying that you have a head which obeying the inspirations
of your heart enables you to discern and <i>appreciate</i>
the truth and extricate it, as well, from the entangle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>ments
of chicanery and fraud. Be assured, my dear
Madam, that I shall treasure up your letter fondly, at
once as a consolation and as a powerful support of the endeavors
which I have been making for years to rescue my
name from the obloquy of an accusation, than which nothing
falser or fouler ever fell from the lips of men or devils.</p>

<p>It was a severe shock for my faith in human nature
when General Speed&mdash;with whom I had maintained relations
of cordial friendship for some fifty years&mdash;suddenly
allowed himself to become a compliant coadjutor of Andrew
Johnson in his diabolical plot to destroy me. The
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of suppressing the truth, which he voluntarily assumed
for himself and in which&mdash;without explanation or
defense&mdash;he persisted down to his grave, amounted fully
to this and to nothing less. Yet during all of that time
he <i>knew</i> me to be innocent, as well as I myself knew and
know it, and this he never denied. Alas, Alas! what a
masquerade is human life, and amid its heady currents
how rarely do we pause to think of the possibilities that
lurk under the disguise of its spotless reputations!</p>

<p>I should be rejoiced to hear that the Summer has strewed
flowers and only flowers on the paths of your "outing,"
and that you will be able to return to Washington glad
of heart and reinvigorated for the social duties in which
you find and bestow so much pleasure. For my own isolated
and infirm life home was thought to be the best
place, and hence I have remained here happily finding
under my own roof a contentment that has left me without
envy of those whose more fortunate feet have sought
the seashore and the mountain slopes. You yourself, however,
acted wisely and well in going away, since the world
is still pressing to <i>your</i> lips the sparkling cups, which for
my own are now but a dim, receding memory.</p>

<p>I congratulate you on Miss Rose's approaching marriage
which you have been so good as to announce, and
sincerely hope that all the bright visions which the coming
event must be awakening will have an abounding fulfilment.
The invitation with which you have honored me
is accepted with thanks, and I shall attend the ceremony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
with the higher gratification, realizing as I shall how
closely your own happiness is bound up with that of your
daughter.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>My dear Mrs. Gouverneur:</p>

<p>I am in receipt of your very welcome letter of the 1st
instant and hasten to send the "Index" as requested.
Hope it may be of service in illustrating and supporting
your application. I shall preserve the Admiral's [Rear
Admiral Francis A. Roe, U.S.N.] emphatic words as a
cherished testimonial. The language of Mrs. Stanard is
also very grateful to me. Her favorable opinion is the
more prized and precious because she has known me so
long and so well.</p>

<p>And now, my dear good friend, how can I sufficiently
thank you for your generous interest in this trouble of
mine&mdash;which has been a thorn in my life for so many
years&mdash;and for your surpassingly kind offices which have
been so effectively exercised in connection with it? Be
assured that while my poor words cannot adequately express
it, my heart will always throb with gratitude for the
tokens of good will with which you have so honored and
gladdened me.</p>

<p>I feel much complimented by so early a receipt of the
invitation to Miss Rose's wedding, and I shall have great
joy in being present.</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Gouverneur:</p>

<p>I regret to be obliged to acknowledge the receipt of your
welcome letter by the hand of another, owing to the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>dition
of my eyes. For many weeks their inflammation
has prevented me from reading or writing, and I fear that
this condition will continue for a good while to come. So
soon as I am able to do so I will either write or have the
pleasure of calling on you. In the meanwhile believe
me most grateful for your letter which, however, has been
but imperfectly read. The darkened chambers of my life
never had more need than at present of the sunshine
which your sympathizing letters have always brought me.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Very sincerely yours,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Washington, D.C.</span>, Jan. 26th, 1893.</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Gouverneur:</p>

<p>Your last two letters have been received and I thank
you heartily for them. As tokens of your continued
friendly remembrance they are precious to me. I am
much obliged for the privilege of reading the letter of
Mrs. Vance [Mrs. Zebulon B. Vance], which is herewith
returned. It is another of the many indications I have
had of the subtle and wide spread circulation given to the
Johnson-Speed calumny to which you refer. It seems to
me that the poison is beyond the reach of any human antidote,
and that I must look to God alone for shelter from
it. Your generous and effective good offices in this matter,
so deeply affecting my reputation and happiness, have
filled my heart with an enduring gratitude.</p>

<p>Your unflagging solicitudes, too, for my poor waning life
have much added to that debt of gratitude, great as it was
and is. Let the good Lord be praised for ever and ever
that spirits such as yours have been born into the world.</p>

<p>I am obliged to address you in this brief and unsatisfactory
manner by the hand of another. After two years
and a half of continued treatment I have as yet received
no relief whatever, nor do the eminent physicians who
have treated me afford me any encouragement for the
future. While the world feasts, it is evident that <i>my</i> lot is
and must be <i>ashes</i> for <i>bread</i>.</p>

<p>Hoping that you are drinking yourself freely from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
fountain of happiness you open for others, I remain</p>

<p class='indent3'>Very sincerely your friend,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">J. Holt</span>.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">Washington, D.C.</span>, April 12, 1893.</p>

<p>My dear good friend:</p>

<p>I regret much to be obliged to communicate with you
by the hand of another, but my poor life seems to be fixed
by fate on the down grade, and at present there is no encouragement
to believe that the future has anything better
in store for me.</p>

<p>I send you a number of the North American Review
containing the correspondence to which you refer between
General Speed and myself. In it there is also a detached
printed letter of Colonel Brown which is important. And
I must ask that both this letter and the number of the
Review be carefully preserved and after their perusal by
your friend be returned to me, as I have no other copies
and wish to preserve these. I am sorry that the sad circumstances
of my condition prevent me from thanking
you in person for your continued interest in my reputation
which has been so basely assailed, but I trust as triumphantly
vindicated.</p>

<p>I thank you sincerely for what you have said of Mrs.
Kearny. It would be a great gratification to me to have
an interview with her on the long, long ago, but this is a
pleasure which I now have no encouragement to promise
myself.</p>

<p>Believe me most grateful for the repeated calls and inquiries
as to my health which you have been so good as to
make. Such calls are precious fountains of consolation
that will not go dry.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Very sincerely your friend,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">J. Holt</span>.</p></div>

<p>It has been asserted upon high authority that after the
conviction and sentence of Mrs. Surratt her daughter
Anna, as well as Catholic priests and prominent men in
Washington, attempted to see the President in order to intercede
for executive clemency in her behalf, but were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
denied admission by Preston King, Collector of the Port
of New York and then a guest at the White House, and by
U.S. Senator James Lane of Kansas. It has also been
said that Mrs. Stephen A. Douglas succeeded in reaching
the President by pushing herself past the guards, but her
attempts in behalf of the condemned woman were fruitless.</p>

<p>I knew Preston King very well and his political career
interested me deeply. He was from St. Lawrence County,
New York, and in my girlhood I often heard it asserted
that the mantle of Silas Wright had fallen upon him. I
saw much of him in 1849 when I was visiting the Scotts
in Washington, and was particularly impressed by his exceptionally
sensitive nature. General Scott once told me
that at one period of his military career he was ordered
to quell a disturbance between Canadians and Americans
near Ogdensburg, the home of Mr. King, and that the
latter was so seriously affected by the scenes he witnessed
at that time that it was long before he recovered his
normal condition of mind. During President Johnson's
administration Mr. King, while Collector of the Port of
New York, boarded a Jersey City ferry boat one morning,
attached weights to his person and jumped into the river.
When the news of his death reached me I was not surprised
as I had seen evidences of his nervous temperament
which might well result in acts indicative of an
unbalanced mind. He was a man of big heart and exceptional
ability, and in his death the State of New York lost
one of her most gifted and distinguished sons.</p>

<p>The Frederick County agricultural fairs, as far back
as my memory of that quaint Maryland town goes, have
always been a feature of special interest not only to the
farmers of that productive region but also from a social
point of view. In bygone days some of the most distinguished
men of the nation made addresses at these "cattle
shows," as they were called by the country folk. I recall
the visit of President Grant on one of these occasions when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
he was the guest of Mrs. Margaret Goldsborough. He
was accompanied by General Sherman and made a brief
address. The evening of the day these distinguished
guests arrived Mrs. Goldsborough gave a dinner in their
honor, which Mr. Gouverneur and I attended. The entertainment
was served in the style then prevalent among old
Maryland families in that vicinity, the <i>pi&egrave;ces de resistance</i>
being chicken, fried to perfection, at one end of the table
together with an old ham on the opposite end. To these
were added "side trimmings," enough to almost bury the
table under their weight. President Grant was then filling
his first term as Chief Executive of the nation and,
although Mr. Gouverneur had known him in Mexico, it
was my first glimpse of the distinguished man. As a
whole we were a merry party, but Grant was a reticent
guest. General Sherman, however, as usual made up for
all deficiencies in this line, and as he sat next to me I
found him to be a highly agreeable conversationalist.
This dinner party proved a great social success and at its
conclusion a number of prominent citizens called to pay
their respects to the guests of honor.</p>

<p>The next year Horace Greeley was the orator of the day
at the Frederick fair, and it fell to our lot to entertain
him. He wrote the following letter to my husband:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'><span class="smcap">New York Tribune</span>, New York, Oct. 1, 1871.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I expect to be duly on hand to fulfil my engagement to
speak at your County Fair and to stop with you, if that
shall be agreeable to those who have invited me. Will
you please see Mr. C. H. Keefer who invites me and say
to him that I am subject to his order and, with his consent,
I shall gladly accept your invitation.</p>

<p class='indent3'>Yours,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>.</p>

<p>
S. L. Gouverneur, Esq.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederick, Maryland.</p>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>As Mr. Greeley about this time was appearing upon
the political horizon as a prospective presidential candidate,
much interest was naturally centered in his visit.
His appearance was decidedly interesting. He was of
the blond type, past middle life and in dress anything but
<i>&agrave; la mode</i>. I am no student of physiognomy, but if the
question had been asked I should have said that his most
prominent trait of character was benevolence. He wore
during this memorable visit the characteristic white hat,
miniature imitations of which during his presidential candidacy
became a campaign badge. I am the fortunate possessor
of two of these souvenirs. They are made of white
metal and are attached to brown ribbons, the color of the
latter standing for B. Gratz Brown, the candidate for
Vice-President upon the Greeley ticket.</p>

<p>This visit was the pleasing forerunner of a sincere
friendship between my husband and Horace Greeley. In
our intimate association of a few days we recognized as
never before his conscientious purpose and intellectual
power, and Mr. Gouverneur was so deeply impressed by
his remarkable ability and sterling character that later in
the same year he started a newspaper in Frederick, which
he called <i>The Maryland Herald</i>, with a view of advocating
his nomination for the Presidency. My husband had
never before been especially interested in politics, but he
now entered the political arena with all the enthusiasm
of his intense nature, and, at a mass meeting in Frederick,
was chosen a delegate to the National Liberal Republican
Convention in Cincinnati, which resulted in the nomination
of Greeley and Brown. Although this party was
largely composed of Republicans who had become dissatisfied
with the Grant administration, it will be remembered
that its candidates were subsequently endorsed by
the Democratic party at its convention in Baltimore, and
that the fusion of such hitherto discordant political elements
added exceptional interest to the subsequent cam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>paign.
The venerable Thomas Jefferson Randolph, grandson
of the author of the Declaration of Independence, although
he had reached the advanced age of eighty years,
was chosen as the temporary chairman of the Baltimore
Convention. The proceedings of the Cincinnati delegates
were replete with interest and the enthusiasm was intense.
During the uproarious demonstration in the convention
hall, immediately following Greeley's nomination, Mr.
Gouverneur's friend, John Cochrane of New York, of whom
I have spoken elsewhere, in the excitement of the moment
gave expression to his delight in an Indian war dance,
and other usual scenes of boyish hilarity prevailed.</p>

<p>My husband's paper had been the first of the Maryland
press, and long before the Convention, to place the name
of Greeley at the head of its columns, but others
followed, and for a time the movement, both in that
State and elsewhere, appeared to gain strength and to assume
formidable proportions. Subsequent events, however,
proved that it would have been better if the newborn
babe had been strangled at its birth, as it was destined to
enjoy but a brief and precarious existence. Although the
movement commanded the support of the united Democracy
and enlisted the active sympathies of able men from
the Republican ranks&mdash;such as Carl Schurz, Whitelaw
Reid, Charles A. Dana, Charles Francis Adams, Lyman
Trumbull, David Davis, Andrew G. Curtin and many
more&mdash;the voice of the people pronounced for Grant, and
in the latter part of the same month that witnessed his
defeat, poor Greeley died of a broken heart!</p>

<p>Greeley's defeat was a severe blow to Mr. Gouverneur.
As the member from Maryland of the national committee
of the Liberal Republican Party, he had engaged in the
contest with his characteristic ardor, and his strenuous
but unsuccessful efforts had made inroads upon his health
that he could but ill afford. Under the circumstances, a
change of scene and employment seemed highly expedient,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
and we accordingly decided to break up our attractive
home in Frederick and return to Washington, where so
much of Mr. Gouverneur's life had been spent and where
I, too, had so many pleasant associations. It was in the
summer of 1873 that this plan was consummated, and we
began our second Washington life in a house which we
bought on Corcoran Street, near Fourteenth Street. It
was one of a row of dwellings built as an investment by
the late George W. Riggs, the distinguished banker, and
was in a portion of the city which still abounded in vacant
lots. Houses in our vicinity were so widely scattered
that we had an almost uninterrupted view of that part of
the District boundary which is now Florida Avenue. As
these were the days of horse cars, it was my habit to stand
in my vestibule and wait for a car, as I could see it approaching
a long distance off, although we lived half a
block from the route, which was on Fourteenth Street.
The entire northwestern section of the city, which is now a
semi-palatial region, was also, at that time, largely a sea of
vacant lots. The only house on Dupont Circle was "Stewart
Castle," and the fashionable part of the city was still
that portion below Pennsylvania Avenue, bounded on the
east by Seventeenth Street, although the general trend
in the erection of fine residences was towards the northwest.
Many of the streets were not paved, but the <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
of Alexander R. Shepherd, familiarly called "Boss
Shepherd," changed all of this, and the work of grading
commenced. It was a trying ordeal for property owners,
as it left many houses high in the air and others below the
customary grade, while many from the ranks of the poorer
classes, unable to meet the necessary assessments, were
forced to part with their homes. In the course of several
years, however, the situation righted itself. Cellars were
dug and English basements became prevalent, and it is
only occasionally that one now sees a house far above the
level of the street. We sometimes hear the praises of Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Shepherd sung, and without a doubt he made Washington
the beautiful city it is to-day, but he accomplished it only
at a tremendous cost&mdash;the sacrifice of many homes. Next
followed the paving of the streets with wooden blocks; and
I was much surprised when they were being laid on Fourteenth
Street, as I recalled the time during my earlier days
in New York when they were used in paving Broadway,
and I also well remember how speedily they degenerated
and decayed. I was told, however, that this form of block
was an improvement upon the old style, and was induced
to believe it until I saw Fourteenth Street and Pennsylvania
Avenue masses of holes and ruts!</p>

<p>After we were fairly settled in our new home I made
the pleasing discovery that my next door neighbors were
our old acquaintances, Mr. and Mrs. Edmund Pendleton
Gaines. Mrs. Gaines was Frances Hogan, a former
neighbor of ours in Houston Street in New York. William
Hogan, her aged father, was living with her, and
their close proximity recalled many early memories. He
was a gentleman of broad culture and a proficient linguist,
and at an early age had accompanied his father
to the Cape of Good Hope. He formed an intimacy with
Lord Byron at Harrow, where he received the early portion
of his education. Byron was not then a student but
was occupying a small room at Harrow, which he called
his "den." Another of Mr. Hogan's daughters, who is
still living, wrote me that at this time Lord Byron was a
young man and her father a little boy. She says: "Lord
Byron often admitted my father to his room, when he
would make him repeat stories of his African life and
describe the occasional appearance of an orang-outang
walking through the streets of Cape Town." After his
father's return to New York, Mr. Hogan attended Columbia
College, from which he was graduated in 1811, and
afterwards studied law. He subsequently purchased land
in the Black River country and did much to develop that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
portion of his native State. The town of Hogansburg in
Franklin County was named after him. He became a
county judge and member of Congress and later resided in
Washington, where he was employed in the Department of
State, first as an examiner of claims and then as an official
interpreter.</p>

<p>A short distance from our home and on the same street
lived Dr. and Mrs. Alexander Sharp with their large and
interesting family of children, one of whom, bearing the
same name as his father, recently died in Washington
while a Captain in the Navy. Dr. Sharp's wife was a
younger sister of Mrs. U. S. Grant, and her husband was
ably filling at the time the position of U.S. Marshal of
the District of Columbia. A few doors from Mrs. Sharp's
lived her sister-in-law, the widow of Louis Dent; and in
the same block, but nearer Thirteenth Street, were the residences
of two agreeable Army families, Colonel and Mrs.
Almon F. Rockwell and Colonel and Mrs. Asa Bacon
Carey, the latter of whom was the niece of the late Senator
Redfield Proctor of Vermont. I formed a pleasant friendship
almost immediately with Mrs. Sharp and was always
received with much cordiality in her home. Corcoran
Street, in fact, from a social point of view, proved to be an
ideal locality until its tranquillity was disturbed by the
advent of Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and family, the former of whom was
the Washington representative of a prominent New York
daily paper whose columns had been strongly denunciatory
of Grant and antagonistic to his election, while they
abounded in praises of Greeley. Both Mr. and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;
were persons of much culture, but they were unfortunate
in their selection of a home, as the personal and political
sentiment of the neighborhood was friendly to Grant, while
his family connections, the Dents and Sharps, residing in
that part of the city, were deservedly popular. My own
position was one of much delicacy. Although I was especially
fond of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Sharp, I could not, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
view of Mr. Gouverneur's active interest in the Greeley
campaign, be quite so enthusiastic over the Grant administration
as were most of my neighbors, and, therefore,
when I was invited by a mutual friend to call upon Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;
I had no hesitation in doing so. I was taken to task
for my act, however, by some of my friends, but I survived
the rebuke and am still alive to tell the tale. I was
told that, several months after the family just referred to
was established in its Corcoran Street home, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;
was returning unaccompanied to her residence one evening,
when a colored man, carrying a bucket of mud in one
hand and a brush in the other, ran after her and besmeared
her clothing; but the Dents and Grants were not of the
class of people to approve of such a ruffianly act, nor
were any of the other decent residents in the community.
If Mrs. Sharp ever had any feeling in connection with my
calling upon Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, I never knew of it. Our relations
were of the most cordial character from the first, and when
her niece, Nellie Grant, was married to Algernon Sartoris
she brought me a box of wedding cake, coupling with
it the remark that she knew of no one more entitled to it
than I&mdash;referring, I presume, to the associations connecting
the Gouverneur family with the White House. After
the close of the Grant administration, Dr. Sharp was appointed
a paymaster in the Army and for many years resided
with his family in Yankton, Dakota. I remained
in touch with Mrs. Sharp, however, and for a long period
we kept up an active correspondence.</p>

<p>At this period Vice-Presidents were not so much <i>en &eacute;vidence</i>
as later, and Vice-President and Mrs. Schuyler Colfax
lived quietly in Washington and mingled but little in
the social world. During his life at the Capital, Mr. Colfax
repeatedly delivered his eloquent oration on Lincoln,
which concluded with the lines of N. P. Willis on the
death of President William Henry Harrison:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Directly back of us on Q Street lived an old and intimate
friend of mine, Mrs. Septimia Randolph Meikleham, the
last surviving grandchild of Thomas Jefferson. She was
the widow of Dr. David Scott Meikleham of Glasgow, who
was a relative of Sir Walter Scott and died in early life
in New York. Mrs. Meikleham was the seventh daughter
(hence her name "Septimia," suggested by her grandfather)
of Governor Thomas Mann Randolph of Virginia
and his wife Martha, the younger daughter of
Thomas Jefferson. She was born at Monticello and was
familiarly known to her intimate friends as "Tim," a
name in surprising contrast with her elegance and dignity.
She bore a striking resemblance to her grandfather,
and, although a woman of commanding presence, was simple
and unaffected in manner. Strong in her convictions,
attractive in conversation and loyal in her friendships,
she and her home were sources of great delight to me, and
it was pleasing to both of us that her children and mine
should have been brought into intimate contact. Mrs.
Meikleham and I often dwelt upon this family intimacy
extending unbroken from Jefferson and Monroe down to
the fourth generation. In the same block with Mrs. Meikleham
lived Mr. and Mrs. John W. Douglas, the former
of whom, some years later, during the Harrison administration,
was one of the District Commissioners. A
daughter of his is the wife of Henry B. F. Macfarland,
the late Senior Commissioner of the District, who, as well
as his wife, is universally respected and beloved in Washington.
On the same street, but on the other side of
Fourteenth Street, Colonel and Mrs. Robert N. Scott resided
for many years; while just around the corner, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Iowa Circle, in what was then a palatial home, lived Allan
McLane and his only child, Anne, who married from
this house John Cropper of New York. She is now a
widow but lives in Washington, where she is greatly beloved.
In this same general region, on the corner of
N and Fourteenth Street, lived Lieutenant Commander
(now Rear Admiral) and Mrs. Francis J. Higginson,
and the latter's attractive sister, Miss Mary
Haldane.</p>

<p>Not far from our dwelling on Corcoran Street lived the
attractive wife of <i>Monsieur</i> Grimaud de Caux, <i>Chancelier</i>
of the French legation, who left unfading memories behind
her. During our many delightful chats I was much
interested in the accounts of her early life and experiences
in Ireland, and I especially recall many things she told me
concerning the members of the Wilde family, with whom
she had been quite intimately associated. I learned from
her that Oscar Wilde inherited his &aelig;sthetic tastes largely
from his mother. She was a woman of unusual type and
habitually dressed in white&mdash;at a time, too, before white
garments had become so generally prevalent. I was also
told that Oscar Wilde's father was an oculist of some
prominence, and that he built a mansion so singular in its
construction that the wits of Dublin called it "Wilde's
eye-sore."</p>

<p>Another of my intimate friends of those days was Mrs.
Mary Donelson Wilcox, widow of the Hon. John A. Wilcox,
formerly Secretary of the U.S. Senate, a Member of Congress
and a veteran of the Mexican War. She was a
woman of rare intellectual ability, and subsequent to her
husband's death was for a time one of the official translators
of the government. She was the daughter of Colonel
Andrew Jackson Donelson, a nephew of President
Jackson as well as his adopted son and private secretary.
General Jackson when President was a widower,
and it was while Mrs. Donelson was presiding as mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of the White House that Mrs. Wilcox was born. Her
memory remained clear until her last illness, and her recollections
of prominent men and events, extending back to
her childhood, and especially those of her early life at the
White House, were of exceptional interest. I was especially
amused by her account of the prompt manner in
which General Jackson sent her mother back to Tennessee
because she refused to accord social recognition to the
wife of General John H. Eaton, his Secretary of War.
As is well known, this was "Peggy O'Neal" who, before
her marriage to Eaton, was the widow of Purser John B.
Timberlake of our Navy, who committed suicide while
serving in the Mediterranean. The relation which she
sustained to the disruption of Jackson's cabinet has passed
into history and is too well known to bear repetition here.
As Colonel Donelson shared the views of his wife, he resigned
his position as the President's private secretary and
returned with her to Tennessee. He was succeeded by
Nicholas P. Trist of the State Department, but a few
months later, through the kindly offices of personal friends,
they were both restored to Jackson's favor and resumed
their former functions in the White House.</p>

<p>Just across the street from our home lived Mr. and Mrs.
Bernard P. Mimmack and the latter's mother, Mrs. Mary
Bailey Collins, widow of Captain Charles Oliver Collins
of the U.S. Army, and a typical representative of the
New York gentlewomen of former days. She was one of
the Bailey family, which was much identified with the history
of New York, and she and her daughter, Mrs. Mimmack,
were valuable additions to our community. Of Mr.
Mimmack, only recently deceased, I can speak only in
terms of the warmest praise. He was a true friend to me
and many times during my widowhood placed his ripe
judgment and wide experience at my command.</p>

<p>As I first remember Professor and Mrs. Joseph Henry,
they were living with their three daughters in a portion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
of the Smithsonian Institution. He was a man whose public
career and private life commanded universal respect,
while his scientific discoveries, both at Princeton College
and at the National Capital, marked him as one of the most
distinguished men of his day. I am not qualified to pronounce
upon his scholarly attainments nor upon the estimate
in which he is held by the learned world of to-day,
but it may be assumed that the eulogistic words of the late
Professor Simon Newcomb, himself a scientific giant, represent
the truth. "Professor Joseph Henry, first secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution," he wrote, "was a
man of whom it may be said, without any reflection on
men of our generation, that he held a place which has
never been filled. I do not mean his official place, but
his position as the recognized leader and exponent of scientific
interests at the National Capital. A world-wide reputation
as a scientific investigator, exalted character and inspiring
presence, broad views of men and things, the love
and esteem of all, combined to make him the man to whom
all who knew him looked for counsel and guidance in matters
affecting the interests of science. Whether anyone
could since have assumed this position, I will not venture
to say; but the fact seems to be that no one has been at
the same time able and willing to assume it."</p>

<p>The society circle in Washington in 1873 was small
compared with that of to-day. There was much less form
and ceremony, fewer social cliques and a greater degree
of affability. The "Old Washingtonians" were more <i>en
&eacute;vidence</i> than now and the political element came and
went without disturbing in any marked degree the harmony
of the social atmosphere. There were, however,
many in public life whose families were cordially received
into the most exclusive circles of Washington society and
enriched it by their presence. Mrs. Hamilton Fish held
social sway by the innate force of character and general
attractiveness with which nature had so lavishly endowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
her. Mrs. James G. Blaine, whose husband was in Congress
when I first knew them, shared in his popularity.
Mrs. George M. Robeson, wife of Grant's Secretary of the
Navy, lived on K Street and kept open house. The Secretary
of the Treasury and Mrs. William A. Richardson,
who lived in the old Hill house on H Street, were well
known and very popular. Francis Kernan, the junior
Senator from New York, with his wife and daughter, was
seen everywhere. Thomas Kernan, their son, who eventually
became a Roman Catholic priest, was a great dancer
and a general favorite. Roscoe Conkling, the senior Senator
from New York, was socially disposed, but his wife,
who was a sister of Horatio Seymour, although well fitted
for social life, took but little part in it. She was a pronounced
blond, wore her hair in many ringlets and was
<i>petite</i> in figure. Senator and Mrs. Henry L. Dawes and
their intellectual daughter, Miss Anna, were highly esteemed
by Washingtonians. General Ambrose B. Burnside,
Senator from Rhode Island and a widower, lived on
H Street, where he lavishly entertained his friends. Senator
Joseph R. Hawley and wife of Connecticut and the
latter's bright sister, Miss Kate Foote, resided in the Capitol
Hill neighborhood; while Senator Henry B. Anthony,
also of Rhode Island and a widower, was famous for his
grasshopper turkeys, with which he liberally supplied his
guests at his home on the southwest corner of H and Fourteenth
Streets. This was the period when William E.
Chandler was beginning his prominent and successful
political career. He lived with his first wife and interesting
family of boys on Fourteenth Street below G Street.</p>

<p>The social leader in Washington in 1873 was Mrs. Frances
Lawrence Ricketts, whose husband, General James B.
Ricketts, U.S.A., had served his country during the Civil
War and on account of disabilities was awarded a handsome
pension. They lived on G Street between Eighteenth
and Nineteenth Streets and her Friday afternoons were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
festive occasions. Mrs. Ricketts was no mean philanthropist
in her way and a certain wag once wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here comes Mrs. Ricketts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a pocketful of tickets.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The doggerel had a basis in fact as she frequently appeared
in public with tickets to sell for the benefit of some
charitable object; and she sold them, too, as but few had
the courage to refuse her. She was an exceedingly fine
looking woman with a cordial manner and graceful bearing.
Mrs. Julia A. K. Lawrence, her mother, the widow of
John Tharp Lawrence, originally of the Island of Jamaica,
lived with her, was quite as fond of society as the daughter,
and, although advanced in years, seemed to have more
friends and admirers than any woman I have ever known.</p>

<p>One day by chance I met her in the drawing-room of a
mutual friend, Mrs. Sallie Maynadier, where she shocked
us by fainting. One of my daughters wrote her a note of
sympathetic inquiry and received in reply the following
answer. I regarded it as a somewhat remarkable note as
its writer was then approaching her ninetieth birthday.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Pray accept my grateful thanks, my dear Miss Gouverneur,
for your kind attention in writing me such a lovely
note. I wish I had known you brought it. I would have
been so much pleased to see you in my room, which I
could not leave yesterday though very much better. I
think the fainting was from the heat of Mrs. Maynadier's
parlour and the agitation of the previous day, at the prospect
of parting with my very dear friends in the delicate
state of dear Kate Eveleth's health! I hope to hear to-day
how she bore the journey, the beautiful day very much in
her favor! I can not close this note without expressing
my sincere wish that your mamma and yourself will be so
kind as to come and see me during the winter. I know that
Mrs. Gouverneur does not "pay visits" but as I can no
longer have the pleasure of meeting you at our dear friend's
I hope she will make an exception in favor of such an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
woman as myself, one too who has known and loved so
many of your father's family for generations, dating back
to President Monroe's family, when I was a child in England
and used to play often with your grandmamma
[Maria Hester Monroe]. Can you believe that a vivid
memory can turn back so many years? Ask your mamma
to favour me and come yourself to see</p>

<p class='indent3'>Yours very truly,</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">Julia Lawrence</span>.</p>

<p>1829 G Street,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday morning.</p>
</div>

<p>An old family friend of Mrs. Lawrence and her daughter,
the late Dr. Basil Norris, U.S.A., a native of Frederick,
resided in the Ricketts home, and I am certain that
his memory is still revered in the District. When Mrs.
Ricketts, upon her husband's death, broke up her Washington
home, Dr. Norris went to San Francisco to reside.
A daughter of mine on her way to join her husband in
Honolulu was taken seriously ill in that city and was attended
by him with consummate skill. He was then on
the retired list of the Army, but had a large and fashionable
practice in his newly adopted home.</p>

<p>In connection with Mrs. Lawrence my memory brings
vividly before me my old and valued friends, Mrs.
Maynadier, widow of General William Maynadier of the
Ordnance Department of the Army, and her witty sister,
Kate Eveleth. To render acts of kindness seemed their
natural avocation, and I never think of them without recalling
Sir Walter Scott's description of a ministering
angel. I have heard Mrs. Maynadier say that at the time
of her marriage her husband, then a young officer, was receiving
a salary of only six hundred dollars; and yet she
reared a large circle of children, her daughters marrying
into prominent families and her sons becoming professionally
well known. Their father was Aide to General
Scott in the Black Hawk War and performed similar duty
under General Alexander Macomb. Their mother lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
to see the fourth generation of her descendants, many of
whom still reside in the District.</p>

<p>When I returned to Washington, I found the old Decatur
house facing Lafayette Square owned and occupied
by General and Mrs. Edward F. Beale, who had recently
returned from a long residence in California. Mr. Gouverneur
had known the General&mdash;"Ned" Beale, as he was
usually called&mdash;in other days and I soon derived much
pleasure from Mrs. Beale's acquaintance. She was a
woman of the most aristocratic bearing and was especially
qualified to meet the exacting requirements of the
most exclusive society. The household was rendered additionally
brilliant by her two daughters, both of whom
were then unmarried. The sparkling vivacity of the
elder, Miss Mary Beale, who subsequently became Madame
Bakhmeteff of Russia, is easily recalled; while her sister,
now Mrs. John R. McLean, is so well known in Washington
and elsewhere as to render quite superfluous any attempt
to describe her many charming qualities. Their
home was a social rendezvous, and I especially recall an
entertainment I attended there when I met many social
celebrities. General Beale had collected numerous relics
of early California which seemed peculiarly adapted to the
historic mansion, and these objects of interest, together
with the highly polished floors, the many and brilliant
lights and the large assemblage of society folk in their
"best bibs and tuckers," presented a scene which is not
readily effaced from one's memory. Among others I met
that evening were General Ambrose E. Burnside, whom
I had known as a cadet at West Point, and my old friend,
Captain (afterwards General) Richard Tyldin Auchmuty
of New York, who since I had last seen him had passed
through the Civil War. This reception was given in
honor of the then young but gifted tragedian, John E.
McCullough, with whom the Beale family had formed a
friendship in the far west.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>TO THE PRESENT DAY</h3>


<p>Shortly after our return to Washington we received
an invitation to a party at the house of Mr.
and Mrs. William A. Richardson, the former Secretary
of the Treasury in Grant's cabinet. In my busy
life I have never seemed inclined to devote much time to
the shifts and vagaries of fashionable attire. Although
as a woman I cannot say that I have been wholly averse
to array myself in attractive garments, they were always
matters of secondary consideration with me and have yet
to cause me a sleepless night. My indifference now confronted
me, however, with the query as to what I should
wear upon this particular occasion, and I was compelled,
as merchants say, "to take account of stock," especially
as my invitation reached me at too late a day to have a
new gown made. Although while living in Frederick I
did pretty much as I pleased in regard to dress, I realized
that in Washington, willing or unwilling, I might be compelled
to do, to a certain extent, what other people pleased;
but such demands have their reasonable limits, and I
therefore determined to ignore the dictates of fashionable
sentiment and practice a little originality on my own account.
I accordingly decided to wear a handsome and
elaborate dress of a fashion of at least a generation before&mdash;a
light, blue silk with its many flounces embroidered in
straw in imitation of sheaves of wheat. In former years
I had worn with this gown black velvet gloves which were
laced at the side&mdash;a Parisian fancy of the day, a pattern
of which had been sent me by Mrs. Schuyler Hamilton.
These also I concluded to wear with the antiquated dress;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and thus arrayed I attended the party and had a thoroughly
good time, supposing, as a matter of course, that
the incident was closed. The <i>New York Graphic</i>, however,
seemed to think otherwise and dragged me into its
columns in an article which was subsequently copied into
other papers. Although at first I felt somewhat chagrined,
upon further consideration I was inclined to be pleased,
at least with that part of the narrative that made a passing
allusion to my attire. This is what the <i>Graphic</i>
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Among the ladies frequently seen in society this winter
is Mrs. Marian Campbell Gouverneur, daughter of
the late James Campbell of New York and the wife of Samuel
L. Gouverneur, the only surviving grandson of ex-President
James Monroe. Mrs. Gouverneur is an elegant
lady of pleasing manners, sparkling vivacity and possesses
a fund of humor and a mind stored with a variety
of charming information. She has traveled a great deal
and seen much of the fashionable world. Mr. Gouverneur's
mother was married in the White House and&mdash;think
of it!&mdash;on a Spread Eagle&mdash;that is to say, on the
carpet of which that very elastic bird made the central
figure. Suppose Miss Nellie Grant, of whose engagement
rumor outside of Washington talks so loud and this city
appears to know nothing, should take it into her head to
be married on a Spread Eagle, would not the other Eagle,
the public, stretch its wings and utter a prolonged shriek?
Now I ask you candidly, have we retrograded in matters
of taste or become less loyal to the true spirit of our Republican
institutions? Mrs. Gouverneur has the most
wonderful collection of American and Asiatic antiques.
She favors antique styles, even in matters of the toilet,
and at a party last week had her dress looped with the
ornaments which formed part of Mr. Monroe's court dress
when Minister to France. She also wore black velvet
mittens of that date.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>While my sister, Mrs. Eames, was residing in Paris with
her son and daughter, her home on the corner of H and
Fourteenth Streets was occupied by Ward Hunt and his
wife of Utica. Judge Hunt had recently been appointed
a Justice of the Supreme Court, and I immediately renewed
my associations of former days with his family.
Next door to the Hunts lived Mr. and Mrs. Titian J.
Coffey, the former of whom had accompanied ex-Governor
Andrew G. Curtin of Pennsylvania upon his mission to
Russia; and the adjoining residence, the old "Hill house,"
was the home of Mr. and Mrs. James C. Kennedy, the
latter of whom was Miss Julia Rathbone of Albany.
Their hospitality was lavish until the death of Mr. Kennedy,
when his widow returned to Albany where a few
years later she married Bishop Thomas Alfred Starkey of
New Jersey. Mrs. Robert Shaw Oliver, wife of the present
efficient Assistant Secretary of War, is her niece.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Kennedy left Washington, Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Elkin Neil of Columbus, Ohio, with their daughter,
Mrs. William Wilberforce Williams, lived in the "Hill
house." They were people of large means and entertained
on an extensive scale. Mrs. Neil belonged to the Sullivant
family of Ohio whose women were remarkable for
their beauty. The wife of William Dennison, one of the
District Commissioners, was Mr. Neil's sister and her
daughter, Miss Jenny Dennison, was one of the belles of the
Hayes administration. There were so many representatives
of the "Buckeye State" at that time in Washington
that someone facetiously spoke of the city as the "United
States of Ohio." Mr. and Mrs. Matthew W. Galt, parents
of Mrs. Reginald Fendall, lived in the next house in the H
Street block, while adjoining them resided Colonel and
Mrs. James G. Berret. I knew Colonel Berret very well.
Nature had been very lavish in her gifts to him, as he was
the fortunate possessor of intelligence, sagacity and fine
personal appearance. It was his frequent boast, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
that through force of circumstances he had received but
"three months' schooling," but he took advantage of his
subsequent opportunities and became an efficient mayor
and postmaster of the City of Washington, while a prince
might well have envied him his dignified and imposing
address. He sold his attractive home to Justice William
Strong of the U.S. Supreme Court, who with his family
resided in it for many years and then moved into a house
on I Street, near Fifteenth Street, which in late years has
been remodeled and is now the spacious residence of Mr.
Charles Henry Butler.</p>

<p>Directly across the street and in the middle of the block,
between Fourteenth and Fifteenth Streets, lived Colonel
and Mrs. John F. Lee. This is a house which I link with
many pleasing associations. Mrs. Lee, whom I knew as
Ellen Ann Hill, was a member of one of Washington's
oldest families and with her husband had a country home
in Prince George County in Maryland. She was a deeply
religious woman and one of the saints upon earth. She
gave me <i>carte blanche</i> to drop in for an informal supper
on Sunday evenings&mdash;a privilege of which I occasionally
availed myself. Colonel Lee was a Virginian by birth
and a graduate of West Point, but at the beginning of the
Civil War resigned his commission. His brother, Samuel
Phillips Lee, however, who was then a Commander in the
Navy, remained in the service and eventually became a
Rear Admiral. Although differing so widely in their political
views, the two brothers were respected and beloved
by their associates, and never allowed their opinions upon
matters of state to interfere with their fraternal affection.
The only daughter of Colonel Lee, Mrs. Henry Harrison,
usually spends her winters in Washington.</p>

<p>Next door to the Lees on the east lived Senator and Mrs.
Zachariah Chandler, the parents of Mrs. Eugene Hale;
while still further down the street was the residence of
Doctor William P. Johnston, a favorite physician of long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
standing and father of Mr. James M. Johnston and Miss
Mary B. Johnston, the latter of whom is President of the
Society of Old Washingtonians of which I enjoy the
honor of being a member. It is at her home on Rhode
Island Avenue that the privileged few who are members
of this exclusive organization meet once each month to
listen to papers read on topics relating to earlier Washington
and to discuss persons and events connected with
its history. The insignia of the society is an orange ribbon
bearing the words inscribed in black: "Should auld
acquaintance be forgot?" A prominent member of this
organization is Mrs. Anna Harris Eastman, widow of
Commander Thomas Henderson Eastman, U.S.N., and
daughter of the beloved physician, the late Medical Director
Charles Duval Maxwell, U.S.N.</p>

<p>In the opinion of many old Washingtonians no history
of the District of Columbia would be complete without
some mention of The Highlands, the home of the Nourse
family. In years gone by I remember that this ivy-covered
stone house was deemed inaccessible, as it was reached
only by private conveyance or stage coach. The first
time I crossed its threshold I could have readily imagined
myself living in the colonial period, as the furniture was
entirely of that time. When I first knew Mrs. Nourse,
who was Miss Rebecca Morris of Philadelphia, the widow
of Charles Josephus Nourse, she was advanced in life, but
notwithstanding the infirmities of age, she had just acquired
the art of china painting, and was filling orders
the proceeds of which she gave in aid of St. Alban's which
was then a country parish. I frequently passed a day
at this ancestral home, and I especially recall seeing a
wonderful Elizabethan clock in the hallway which I am
told is still, in defiance of time, striking the hours in the
home of a descendant. Near The Highlands is Rosedale,
occupied for many years by the descendants of
General Uriah Forrest, who built it subsequent to 1782.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
He was the intimate friend of General Washington, and
its present occupant, Mrs. Louisa Key Norton, daughter
of John Green and widow of John Hatley Norton of
Richmond, is my authority for the statement that one day
after dining with her grandfather, General Forrest, Washington
walked out upon the portico and, lost in admiration
of the beautiful view, exclaimed: "There is the site
of the Federal City." Mrs. Norton's sister, Miss Alice
Green, married Prince Angelo de Yturbide, and it was
their son, Prince Augustine de Yturbide, who was adopted
by the Emperor Maximilian.</p>

<p>One of the pleasing local features connected with the
Grant administration, which at the time made no special
impression upon me, was the fact that there were then but
few, if any, social cliques in Washington, and that society-going
people constituted practically one large family. A
stranger coming to the Capital at that time and properly
introduced was much more cordially received than now.
Such, for example, was the condition of affairs when Mr.
and Mrs. Alexander Jeffrey came to Washington to spend
a winter. They rented the old Pleasanton house on Twenty-first
Street below F Street and entertained with true
Southern hospitality. The Jeffrey family was of Scotch
extraction and Mrs. Jeffrey was Miss Rosa Vertner of
Kentucky, where she was favorably known as a poetess.
The first wife of Alexander Jeffrey was Miss Delia W.
Granger, a sister of my old and valued friend, Mrs. Sanders
Irving. As soon as they were settled in their home,
Mr. and Mrs. Jeffrey gave a large evening entertainment
which Mr. Gouverneur and I attended. We much enjoyed
meeting there a number of Kentuckians temporarily residing
in Washington&mdash;among others, Mrs. John Key of
Georgetown and her sister, Mrs. Hamilton Smith; Mrs.
William E. Dudley; and Wickliffe Preston and his sister, a
decided blonde who wore a becoming green silk gown.
Madame Le Vert and her daughter, Octavia Walton Le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Vert, were also there and it is with genuine pleasure I recall
the unusual vivacity of the former. This gifted woman was
a pronounced belle from Alabama and had passed much of
her life in Italy, where she had much association with the
Brownings. During her absence abroad the ravages of
our Civil War made serious inroads upon her financial circumstances,
and when she visited Washington at the period
of which I am speaking she gave a series of lectures upon
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Browning in Willard's Hall on F
Street. They received the endorsement of fashionable
society and, at the conclusion of her last appearance, Albert
Pike, the later apostle of Freemasonry, offered as an
additional attraction a short discourse upon his favorite
theme. Madame Le Vert's maiden name was Octavia
Walton, and she was the granddaughter of George Walton,
one of the Signers from Georgia, and the daughter of
George Walton, the Territorial Governor of Florida. In
1836 she married Dr. Henry S. Le Vert, son of the fleet-surgeon
of the Count de Rochambeau at Yorktown, Va.
In 1858 her "Souvenirs of Travel" appeared, and later
she wrote "Souvenirs of Distinguished People" and
"Souvenirs of the War," but, for personal reasons, neither
of the two was ever published.</p>

<p>My first acquaintance with George Bancroft, the historian,
dates back to the year 1845, when he came from
New England to deliver a course of lectures and was the
guest of my father in New York. One of the evenings
he spent with us stands out in bold relief. He was a man
of musical tastes, and Justine Bibby Onderdonk, a friend
of mine and a daughter of Gouverneur S. Bibby, who only
a few days before had made a runaway match with Henry
M. Onderdonk, the son of Bishop Benjamin T. Onderdonk
of New York, happened to be our guest at the same time.
Her musical ability was of the highest order and she delighted
Mr. Bancroft by singing some of his favorite selections.
Later, when he was Secretary of the Navy dur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>ing
the Polk administration, I saw Mr. Bancroft very
frequently. I am not aware whether it is generally
known that he began his political life in Massachusetts
as a Whig. When I first knew him, however, he was a
Democrat and the change in his political creed placed him
in an unfavorable light in his State, most of whose citizens
were well nigh as intolerant of Democrats as their ancestors
had been of witches in early colonial days.</p>

<p>Upon my return to Washington I soon renewed my acquaintance
with Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft, and the entertainments
I attended in their home on H Street, between Sixteenth
and Seventeenth Streets, revived pleasant recollections
of Mrs. Clement C. Hill, whose house they purchased
and of whose social leadership I have already
spoken. Mr. Bancroft at this time was well advanced in
years, and in referring to his age I have often heard him
say: "I came in with the century." In spite of the fact,
however, that he had exceeded the years usually allotted
to man, he could be seen nearly every day in the saddle
with Herrman Bratz, his devoted German attendant, riding
at a respectful distance in the rear. I may add, by
the way, that a few doors from the Bancrofts lived Dr.
George Clymer of the Navy with his wife and venerable
mother-in-law, the latter of whom was the widow of Commodore
William B. Shubrick, U.S.N.</p>

<p>Colonel Alexander Bliss, Mrs. Bancroft's son and familiarly
known to Washingtonians as "Sandy" Bliss,
lived just around the corner from his mother's. His wife
was the daughter of William T. Albert, of Baltimore, but
when I knew him best he was a widower. A few doors
from Colonel Bliss lived Senator Matthew H. Carpenter,
a political power of the first magnitude during President
Grant's second presidential term, whose daughter Lilian
was a reigning belle. Equestrian exercise was not then
quite so popular in Washington as later, but it had its
devotees, among whom was Colonel Joseph C. Audenreid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
U.S.A., an unusually handsome man with a decidedly
military bearing. He was generally accompanied by his
daughter Florence, then a child, and was often to be seen
riding out Fourteenth Street towards the Soldiers' Home,
which was then the fashionable drive.</p>

<p>John L. Cadwalader, a cousin of Mr. Gouverneur and
now one of the most prominent members of the New York
bar, was Assistant Secretary of State under Hamilton
Fish during the Grant <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. He was a bachelor and
was accompanied to Washington by his two sisters, both
of whom lived with him in a fine residence on the corner
of L Street and Connecticut Avenue, which has since been
torn down to make way for a large apartment house. It
was while the Cadwaladers were occupying this residence
that I first made the acquaintance of Dr. S. Weir Mitchell.
Miss Mary Cadwalader brought him to see us in our Corcoran
Street home and during the visit announced her engagement
to him. He was then the highly eminent physician
alone, as he had not yet entered the arena of fiction
and poetry in which he has since attained such wide-spread
distinction. It gives me pleasure to add that he
suggested to me, while I was visiting in Philadelphia many
years later, that I should write these reminiscences.</p>

<p>All of the large balls and parties of this date, including
the bachelors' germans, which I frequently attended, were
given at Lewis G. Marini's on the south side of E Street,
near Ninth Street. Marini was an Italian and the dancing
master of the day. Twice a week he went to Annapolis
to teach the midshipmen, who, when subsequently
ordered to duty in Washington, became very acceptable
beaux, as they danced the same step that their master had
taught his pupils here. The bachelors' germans were organized
among others by Robert F. Stockton, Hamilton
Fish, Jr., John Davis, and Hamilton Perkins; while soon
thereafter Seaton Munroe became one of its officers. I
especially recall a german given by the bachelors at Ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>rini's,
on the twenty-second of February, 1876, when Lady
Thornton, wife of Sir Edward Thornton, British Minister
to the United States, received the guests. The decorations
were unusually elaborate, consisting chiefly of American
flags draped along the walls from floor to ceiling;
while at one end of the room, in compliment to the hostess
of the evening, the stars and stripes made way to two
British flags. A small cannon and a miniature ship were
placed below the music gallery, while above them was a
semicircle of cutlasses and a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of glistening
spears behind which were the musicians. In an old
scrap book I find a brief notice of this entertainment which
mentions the belles of the ball, some of whom became
matrons of a later day in Washington and elsewhere.
This is the list:&mdash;Miss Zeilin, Miss Dunn, Miss Kilbourn,
Miss Emory, Miss Campbell, Miss Kernan, Miss Dennison,
Miss Keating of Philadelphia, Miss Patterson, Miss
Jewell, Miss Badger, Miss Warfield, Madame Santa Anna,
Mrs. Gore Jones, Madame Mariscal, Madame Dardon, Mrs.
Belknap, Mrs. Robeson, Mrs. Frederick Grant and Miss
Dodge ("Gail Hamilton").</p>

<p>In the old Stockton house, next door to the residence of
William W. Corcoran, lived Mr. and Mrs. Elijah Ward
who probably entertained more lavishly than any other
family of that day. Mr. Ward was then in Congress from
New York. His wife possessed much grace of manner and
a subtle charm quite impossible to describe. I enjoyed her
intimate friendship and often availed myself of a standing
invitation to take tea with her. In her drawing-room
one constantly met acceptable recruits from social and
political life, all of whom she charmed by her affable conversation
and unaffected bearing. Upon her return to
New York Miss Virginia Stuart, her daughter by a former
marriage, married the Rev. Alexander McKay-Smith, assistant
rector at St. Thomas' Church. Soon after his marriage
he received a call to St. John's Church in Wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>ington,
where he remained the beloved rector until in 1902
he was elected Bishop-Coadjutor of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>It was about this same period that I formed a friendship
with Lieutenant Commander and Mrs. Arent Schuyler
Crowninshield. He was then Ordnance Officer of the
Washington Navy Yard and lived in the quaint old house
later assigned to the second line officer of that station.
Mrs. Crowninshield's sister, Elizabeth Hopkins Bradford,
lived with her and I attended her wedding there. She
married Edmund Hamilton Smith of Canandaigua, New
York, a son of Judge James C. Smith of the Supreme
Court of that State, and the ceremony was performed by the
Rev. Dr. John Vaughan Lewis of St. John's Church, Washington.
This wedding made an indelible impression upon
my memory owing to an unfortunate circumstance which
attended it. The mother of the bride-elect and the latter's
youngest sister, Louise, were traveling in Europe and
had arranged their return passage in ample time, as they
supposed, to be present at the ceremony. The ship met
with an accident off the coast of Newfoundland, however,
and during the delay the wedding took place. There was
much anxiety concerning the safety of the bride's mother
and sister which naturally cast an atmosphere of gloom
over the marriage feast, but in a few days the ship came
into port and unalloyed happiness prevailed. After Mr.
Crowninshield's promotion to a Captaincy in the Navy
he was ordered to command the <i>Richmond</i> in the Philadelphia
Navy Yard, and there I repeatedly met him and
his fascinating wife. He remained there, however, for
less than a year, when he was placed in command of the
ill-fated <i>Maine</i>, and about ten months before she was destroyed
was ordered to Washington as Chief of the
Bureau of Navigation with the rank, first of Commodore
and then of Rear Admiral. He served as such with
marked efficiency during the Spanish-American War, and
several years later commanded the flagship of the Eu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>ropean
Squadron. He retired in 1903 on his own application
and died five years later, deeply regretted by a
large circle of official and personal friends. Mrs. Crowninshield
is so well and favorably known to the public as
an authoress that it would be impossible for me to add
any leaves to the laurels she now wears; but I cannot refrain
from paying a tribute to her remarkable loyalty as
a friend and expressing my admiration for those uncommon
traits of character which, with her commanding presence,
have made her so deeply respected and so greatly
admired.</p>

<p>The first loan-exhibition given in Washington that I
now recall was near the close of Grant's administration,
and was for the benefit of the Church of the Incarnation.
It was in an old house on the corner of Fifteenth and H
Streets, since torn down to make way for the George Washington
University. As much interest was shown in the
enterprise and many of the old Washington families sent
valuable relics, a large sum of money was realized. Among
the contributors were William W. Corcoran, Miss Olive
Risley Seward, Senator John P. Jones of Nevada, and
Seth Ledyard Phelps, the latter of whom was at the time
one of the District Commissioners and owned a large
number of Chinese curios gathered by him during his life
in the East. I, too, was glad to aid so worthy a cause and
sent some of my most cherished possessions. Before the
exhibition was formally opened, I attended a private view
of the collection given in honor of William W. Corcoran
and Horatio King. Of Mr. Corcoran I have elsewhere
spoken; with Mr. King I was also well acquainted. In
1839, while a young man, he was appointed to a position
in the Post Office Department and eleven years later was
connected with its foreign service in which he originated
and perfected postal arrangements of great importance
to the country. His promotion was rapid and he finally
became Postmaster General under President Buchanan, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
position which he held with credit both to the administration
and himself. About 1873, when I first knew Mr.
and Mrs. King, they lived in a modest home at 707 H
Street where, every Saturday evening, many <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i>
and prominent men of state were accustomed to gather
and discuss the important literary and political problems
of the day. John Pierpont read a poem at the first of
these receptions and Grace Greenwood rendered some choice
selections, while George William Curtis and other men of
note contributed their share to the success of other similar
occasions. These literary reunions are said to have
been the first of their kind ever held in Washington.</p>

<p>I was invited one evening in 1877 by Mrs. Madeleine
Vinton Dahlgren, widow of Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren,
U.S.N., who was then living at the corner of L and
Fourteenth Streets, to attend a meeting of the Washington
Historical Society held in her drawing-rooms. It was
Washington's birthday and James A. Garfield, then Senator
from Ohio, was the orator of the evening. In one
portion of his remarks he seemed to go out of his way to
emphasize the statement that Mary Ball, Washington's
mother, was a very plain old woman. Why he considered
that her lack of prominent lineage necessarily added
greater luster to the Father of His Country, was not apparent
to quite a number of his audience, for even the
numerous votaries of the Patron Saint of Erin, "the
beautiful isle of the sea," took honest pride in according
him a gentle descent:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">St. Patrick was a gintleman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He came from dacent people.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Dahlgren was a woman of unusual intellectual ability.
She was the daughter of Samuel Finley Vinton of
Ohio, who for many years represented his district in Congress
and was chairman of the Ways and Means Com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>mittee.
In 1879 she published a small volume entitled
"Etiquette of Social Life in Washington." She followed
this book with another, whose title I do not recall, in which
she dwelt at length upon society in Washington. It was
not well received as her criticisms upon the wives of Cabinet
Officers and others were such as to invoke general
disfavor and arouse bitter resentment. Mrs. Dahlgren's
ablest work, however, was the life of her husband, which
was published in 1882 in a volume of over six hundred
and fifty pages. She had a fine command of the English
language and excellent literary discrimination in the use
of its words, as appears everywhere in her writings and
especially in the following tribute to her husband in the
preface of his Life:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Admiral Dahlgren was a man of science, of inventive
genius, of professional skill; but beyond all these, he was
a <i>patriot</i>. While climbing, at first with slow and toilsome
but reliant steps, and, later on, with swifter, surer progress,
that summit to which his genius urged him, he was
often and again confronted by the clamor of discontent,
the jealousies of his profession, and the various forms of
opposition his rapid, upward course evoked; and until the
present generation of actors in the great drama in which
he played so conspicuous part shall have passed away, it
will be difficult to gain an impartial opinion. Yet Death
having arrested his ultimate conceptions while yet midway
in his career, and set the final seal upon his actions,
we are content to leave the verdict of a 'last appeal'
to his beloved country and the hearts of a grateful
people."</p>

<p>Two years later I attended another meeting of this
Historical Society at the residence of Henry Strong, who
built and owned the house on K Street now occupied by
Mrs. Stephen B. Elkins, and for a time resided there.
It was a brilliant assemblage and it deemed itself fortunate
in having Moncure D. Conway, the distinguished historical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
writer and essayist, as the orator of the evening. He
spoke upon the leaders of the Federal party during the
formative period of our national government, and soon
made it apparent that his sympathies were not with them.
He was strongly denunciatory of the Federalists, going
so far even as to brand some of them as traitors, and
especially criticized Jay's Treaty with England in 1794
which was their pet creation. He spoke at some length
of Oliver Wolcott, one of the most prominent Federalists
of that day, entirely ignorant meanwhile of the fact that
some members of the Tuckerman family, his descendants,
were in the audience. At this time Mr. Conway was writing
the life of Thomas Paine, which has since been published,
and the morning after his lecture on the Federal
party he called upon me to ascertain whether any unpublished
information relating to Paine, which might aid
him in his projected biography of the latter, was to be
found in the private papers of James Monroe which were
in my possession. During our conversation I ventured
to remark to Mr. Conway that possibly he was not aware
that the previous evening certain descendants of Oliver
Wolcott were in his audience. He responded that he had
no desire to give offense but that unfortunately he could
not adapt history to suit the views of the descendants of
early statesmen.</p>

<p>To use a terse expression of Hamlet, I have often heard
that Paine was one of the unfortunates who were not
treated by our government "according to their deserts."
It is now conceded by students of our national history
that no man rendered more effective service to the American
Revolution than "Tom" Paine. His devotion to the
cause and his conspicuous sacrifices in its behalf were repeatedly
acknowledged by Washington, Franklin and all
the lesser lights of the day. After independence had been
secured, still imbued with the spirit of liberty, his pen
and his presence were not wanting when required in be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>half
of the liberties of the French people. He was imprisoned
with hundreds of others in the Luxembourg, where
he languished for nearly eleven months in daily expectation
of being hurried to the guillotine. Following the fall
of Robespierre he was liberated through the kindly offices
of James Monroe, who had succeeded Gouverneur Morris
as our Minister to France, and was at once crowned with
honors by the government in whose behalf he had suffered.
During the term of his imprisonment, it was his
belief that a single word from Washington would effect
his release, and he had a right to expect it, but he waited
in vain. He was wholly unconscious, meanwhile, that the
mind of Washington had been poisoned against him by one
high in public counsels, and while still in ignorance of this
fact addressed him the well-known denunciatory letter
which evoked such wide-spread criticism. Washington,
however, was not to blame, for he had been deceived in the
house of his friends; but of this Paine was entirely ignorant.
Delaware Davis, a son of Colonel Samuel B. Davis
of Delaware who rendered such distinguished service during
the War of 1812, told me a few years ago that his
father was present at a dinner where Paine was asked what
he thought of Washington. Doubtless in a spirit of acrimony
he uttered the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take from the rock the rough and rudest stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It needs no sculptor, it is Washington;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you chisel, let the strokes be rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his bosom write ingratitude.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is probably no period of our national history
when party rivalries were so intense and the expression
of political animosities were more bitter than they were
a century ago between the disciples of Jefferson and Hamilton.
Epithets in popular discourse were openly hurled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
at political antagonists that decent men would not tolerate
to-day, and the public press gave expression to
charges and insinuations against honorable partisans
such as none but the very yellowest and most debauched
journals would now deem it expedient to print. As a
single illustration, I have in my possession what is called
"An infallible remedy to make a true Federalist." It is
without date and was given to me by a descendant of
Thomas Jefferson who knew nothing of its origin except
that it was a Boston production. It speaks for itself, and
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Take the head of an old hypocrite, one ounce of Nero's
conspiracy, two ounces of the hatred of truth, five scruples
of liars' tongues, twenty-five drops of the spirit of
Oliver Cromwell, fifteen drops of the spirit of contentment.
Put them in the mortar of self-righteousness and
pound them with the pestle of malice and sift them through
the skin of a Doctor of Divinity and put the compound
into the vessel of rebellion and steep it over the fire of
Sedition twenty-four hours, and then strain it in the rag
of high treason. After which put it in the bottle of British
influence and cork it with the disposition of Toryism,
and let it settle until the general court rises, and it will
then be fit for use. This composition has never been
known to fail, but if by reason of robust constitution it
should fail, add the anxiety of the stamp act, and sweeten
with a Provisional Army.</p>

<p>The above articles may be had of the following gentlemen
who are appointed wholesale venders of British
Agents in America.</p>

<p class='indent4'><span class="smcap">F. Target.</span></p></div>

<p>The last days of the Grant administration were filled
with forebodings and excitement. I shall always remember,
when the news reached Washington that Rutherford
B. Hayes had been nominated by the Republican party,
the eager inquiries: "Who is Hayes?" It was then I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
heard for the first time an expression which constantly
occurs nowadays&mdash;"A dark horse." Samuel J. Tilden, as
is well known, was the standard bearer of the Democracy.
The fight was long and bitter, as almost up to the day of
the inauguration the question as to which candidate was
successful was a matter of doubt. The Electoral Commission,
the compromise agreed upon by both parties, was
composed of the same number of Republicans and Democrats
with Justice Joseph P. Bradley of the Supreme
Court as the fifteenth member, chosen on account of his
neutral position. It decided that the Republican nominee
was entitled to the electoral votes of Florida, Louisiana
and South Carolina, and the Electoral College accordingly
awarded the Presidency to Mr. Hayes by a vote of 186 to
185.</p>

<p>The Tilden campaign was engineered by Manton Marble,
an able man and the editor of the New York <i>World</i>.
I had known Mr. Tilden when he was a great adherent
of Martin Van Buren. He was a small, insignificant looking
man whose whole life was given up to politics. As I
remember him in general, he was expounding upon his
favorite subject regardless of "time and tide." His
father had been affiliated with the celebrated "Albany
Regency," and the son, inheriting his views, became one
of the ablest as well as shrewdest political leaders that
the Democratic party in New York has ever known. As
a lawyer his great ability was universally recognized, and
yet his last will was successfully contested, although it
had been drawn up by him with almost infinite care and
with the most scrupulous regard for details and engrossed
with his own hand.</p>

<p>I saw the Hayes inaugural-parade from a window on
the corner of Fifteenth Street and New York Avenue.
All through the day there was a suppressed feeling
of uncertainty and excitement, but at the appointed
hour the President-elect drove to the Capitol in the usual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
manner and took the oath of office. The procession which
escorted him to the White House was by no means so
imposing as others I had seen, among them that of eight
years later at Cleveland's first inauguration, when General
Fitzhugh Lee rode at the head of the Virginia troops
and received a greater ovation than the new President
himself. It was late in February before it was definitely
known what the final decision of the Electoral Commission
would be, and the uncertainty arising from this fact,
together with the prevailing political disquietude, doubtless
had much effect in limiting the size of the parade.</p>

<p>I soon made the acquaintance of President and Mrs.
Hayes and was always a welcome guest at the White
House. The latter was of commanding presence and endowed
with great beauty, while she possessed moral and
intellectual traits that not only endeared her in time to
the residents of the Capital but also won for her the respect
and admiration of the people at large. She was
also a woman of strong convictions and exceptional
strength of character, and rarely failed to make her influence
felt in behalf of what she believed to be right.
Although, for example, the attitude she assumed in regard
to the use of wine at the White House entertainments
was a radical departure from precedent and evoked
the antagonism of many of her friends and admirers, she
believed herself to be right and successfully persevered
in her course to the end; so that William M. Evarts,
Hayes's Secretary of State, kept pretty close to the truth
when he asserted years thereafter that "during the Hayes
administration water flowed at the White House like
champagne!" She was a woman of deeply religious experience
and a devout member of the Methodist Church.
Washington society felt the influence of her example, and
during her residence at the White House the Sabbath was
more generally observed at the National Capital than during
any other administration I have known. As time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
passed and we became better acquainted, my respect and
admiration for her greatly increased. I repeatedly spent
the evening with her informally at the White House
when our intercourse was unhampered by red-tape, and
it was then, of course, that I saw her at her best. Her
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> was by no means without its embarrassments. She
necessarily knew that many persons of prominence and
influence viewed with serious doubt the legality of her
husband's title to the Presidential chair and that there
were those who even alluded to him as "His Fraudulency";
but the world was none the wiser, so far as she
was concerned, and she pursued the "even tenor of her
way," and by the subtle influence of her character and
conduct won both for her husband and herself the admiration
of many who, but for her, would probably have remained
their enemies.</p>

<p>In 1863 Stephen J. Field of California was appointed
by President Lincoln a Justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court, and made his residence in one of the three dwelling-houses
on Second Street facing the Capitol, which
is said to have been a gift from his brothers, David Dudley,
the eminent lawyer; Cyrus W., the father of the Atlantic
cable; and the Rev. Dr. Henry M., the eminent
Presbyterian divine and versatile editor of <i>The New York
Evangelist</i>. Here the brothers met every February to
celebrate the birthday of David Dudley Field. For
many years after the destruction of the first Capitol by
the British in the War of 1812, the Field house and the
two which adjoined it were used by Congress as the seat
of its deliberations. Henry Clay served within its walls
as Speaker for about ten years, and Mrs. Field took much
pride in showing her guests the mark on the wall where
his desk stood. At one period before its occupancy by
Judge Field this residence was used as a boarding house,
and in its back parlor John C. Calhoun breathed his last.
During the Civil War it was used by the government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
with the two adjoining houses as the "Old Capitol
Prison"&mdash;but of this I have spoken in another place.
Justice Field was "a gentleman of the old school" and
one of the most courtly men in public life, while his wife
was well known for her tact, culture and exquisite taste.
Their home was enriched with many curiosities collected
at home and abroad, and I especially recall a bust of the
young Emperor Augustus, an exact copy of the original
in the Vatican. Mrs. Field's sister, Miss Sarah Henderson
Swearingen, accompanied her to Washington and
some years later was married from this home to John
Condit-Smith. My old friend, Dr. Charles W. Hoffman,
who for twenty years was the librarian of the U.S. Supreme
Court, was a near neighbor and friend of Judge
and Mrs. Field. After a life well spent he retired to the
home of his birth in Frederick, Maryland, where he lived
for many years, surrounded by his well-loved books and
art treasures. He never married.</p>

<p>When I first knew Mr. and Mrs. James G. Blaine they
were living on Fifteenth Street between H and I Streets.
Miss Abigail Dodge, "Gail Hamilton," a cousin of Mrs.
Blaine, resided with them and added greatly to the
charm of the establishment. The world in general as well
as his eulogists have done full justice to Mr. Blaine's
amazing tact and charm of manner; but I may be pardoned
the conceit if I offer my own tribute by referring
to a graceful remark he made the first time I had the
pleasure of meeting him. I heard someone say: "Here
comes Mr. Blaine," and as I turned and he was formally
presented to me I saw before me a distinguished looking
middle-aged man of commanding presence, who, as he
raised his hat to greet me, remarked in a low and pleasant
voice: "I bow to the name!"</p>

<p>The social column so generally in vogue in all the large
newspapers throughout the country was introduced into
Washington about 1870. Miss Augustine Snead, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
wrote under the <i>nom de plume</i> of "Miss Grundy," was the
first woman society reporter I ever knew. She represented
several newspapers, and she and her mother, Mrs.
Fayette Snead, herself a graceful writer under the pen
name of "Fay," were seen at many entertainments.
Both of them were wide-awake and clever women. I happen
to have preserved an article which appeared in the
society column of <i>The Evening Star</i>, written by Miss
Snead, which is largely made up of puns upon the society
men of the day, some of whom are now gray-haired
veterans and some, alas! are no longer here. She
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our society men are sighing for their rights and complain
that whereas it is only once in four years they have
the privilege of being courted and receiving special attention
the social columns of the newspapers should give them
more space. We have detailed one of our corps for the
purpose with the following result. It (s)Eames to us
that the officers of the Marine Corps are Muse-ing on an
exhibition of their Zeal in the invention of a patent Payne-killer,
in proof that they have not leaned upon a broken
Reed. Some one may call us Palmer (H)off of bad
puns, but we have not given A(u)lick amiss. No wonder
the Marine Corps, in hourly dread of annihilation, has its
anxieties increased by the continuance of the Alarm at the
Navy Yard, the officers of that formidable little vessel having
proved through the season that it is well named, by
each striking eight <i>belles</i> per hour."</p>

<p>"Eames" was my nephew, Charles Campbell Eames.
"Muse" was General William S. Muse, U.S.M.C., now
residing on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, who usually
spends a portion of each year at the Capital. "Zeal in"
referred to Lieutenant William F. Zeilin, U.S.M.C., a son
of General Jacob Zeilin, U.S.M.C. "Payne" was Frederick
H. Paine, formerly in the Navy, who still makes
Washington his home. "Reed" was General George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
C. Reid, U.S.M.C., now residing in Washington.
"(H)off" was Captain William Bainbridge Hoff, U.S.N.,
who died a few years ago; and "Palmer" was Lieutenant
Aulick Palmer, formerly in the Marine Corps and now
U.S. Marshal of the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>When I first knew the distinguished scientist, Professor
Theodore E. Hilgard, he and his wife were living on N
Street, near Twelfth Street. For many years he was
Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and after an interval
of a number of years was succeeded by his nephew,
Mr. Otto H. Tittmann. The latter and his wife are now
among the widely-known and popular residents of Washington.
The French Government in appreciation of Professor
Hilgard's scientific achievements presented to him
a superb vase which is now owned by Dr. Thomas N.
Vincent.</p>

<p>About thirty years ago my daughters and I formed a
friendship with Senator and Mrs. James B. Beck of Kentucky
and their daughter, the wife of General Green Clay
Goodloe of the U.S. Marine Corps. Mr. Beck was one
of the Democratic leaders in the Senate and was regarded
as among the ablest men of his party. He was proud of
his Scotch blood and loyal in his friendships. His wife
was Miss Jane Washington Augusta Thornton, whose
grandfather, Colonel John Thornton of Rappahannock
County, Virginia, was a first cousin of General Washington.
Both the Senator and his wife have passed onward,
but our affection still lives in General and Mrs. Goodloe,
who are among the best and truest friends I have ever
known.</p>

<p>Just before the close of the Hayes administration,
Walter D. Davidge, whose home for many years was on
Sixth Street, built a large mansion on the corner of H
and Seventeenth Streets and upon its completion he and
Mrs. Davidge, who was Miss Anna Louisa Washington,
gave a housewarming. Champagne flowed freely upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
this occasion and it is said that the supper was one of
the handsomest and most elaborate ever served in Washington.
The same winter my daughters attended a
brilliant ball given at Stewart Castle by its chatelaine,
Mrs. William M. Stewart, whose husband was one of the
U.S. Senators from Nevada. She was the daughter of
Senator Henry S. Foote, who represented Mississippi in
ante-bellum days, and gave the ball in honor of several
Virginia girls who were her guests. She was assisted in
the entertainment by her two elder daughters, both of
whom were married. Stewart Castle was well adapted
for such a social function as it was one of the few mansions
in Washington that had a spacious ballroom. This
residence was quite suburban, and the Hillyer house on
Massachusetts Avenue which stood on a high terrace was
the only other dwelling in the immediate vicinity. I
remember that when the home of the British Embassy was
in the course of erection, the wisdom of the location was
greatly questioned, owing to its remoteness from the fashionable
center of the city.</p>

<p>During the Arthur administration, Mr. Edward C. Halliday
and his wife came to the National Capital to spend a
winter. I had known him many years before when he visited
the widow of General Alexander Macomb in her home
on the corner of I and Seventeenth Streets, where the
Farragut apartment house now stands. He was of a
Scotch family which originally settled in New York, and
his father for some years was President of the St. Andrews
Society of that city. After residing several months
in Washington Mr. Halliday built several houses opposite
the British Embassy on N Street, the largest of which he
reserved for his own residence. It was here that Mr. and
Mrs. Halliday entertained with such true Scotch hospitality.
Their Friday evenings were bright spots on the
social horizon, especially for the young people, as dancing
was one of their special features. Just before the close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
of her second social season Mrs. Halliday gave a fancy-dress
ball, which was a happy inspiration, varying as it
did the monotony of germans, receptions and teas. On
this occasion the minuet was danced by the younger
guests dressed in Louis XIV. costumes.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1880 the long and painful illness of
my husband closed in death. He had been handicapped
by years of ill health, and, although he had the intellectual
power, the ability, the wings to spread, there was, alas,
no surrounding air to bear them up! The ambition was
there and the intense desire, but strength was lacking and
he bore his affliction with sublime fortitude. For a while
after his departure I felt akin to a ship lost at sea; my
moorings were nowhere within sight. I had leaned on
him through so many years of married life, constantly
sustained by his high code of integrity and honor, that
his death was indeed a bereavement too terrible for words
to express. I care to say no more.</p>

<p>The summer of the same year, accompanied by my
daughters, I sought the quietude of the mountains of Virginia.
Tarrying in the same house with me was Mrs.
John Griffith Worthington of Georgetown, D.C., with
whom I formed a lasting friendship. The Worthington
family resided in the District long before it became the
seat of government and owned extensive property. Even
in extreme old age Mrs. Worthington was one of the most
truly beautiful women I have ever seen. She was Miss
Elizabeth Phillips of Dayton, Ohio, and a lineal descendant
of President Jonathan Dickinson of Princeton University.
Her daughter Eliza, Mrs. William Henry Philip, represented
the same type of woman. John G. Worthington's
sister married Judge William Gaston, the eminent jurist
of North Carolina.</p>

<p>The administration of Garfield was of short duration.
The tragedy which brought to a speedy close his earthly
career is too well known to be dwelt upon at length.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
The mortal attack upon him in 1881 by the fanatic Charles
J. Guiteau in the old Pennsylvania railroad station on
the corner of Sixth and D Streets shocked the civilized
world, and his long and painful illness at Elberon was
closely watched by a sympathizing public until it closed
in death. Dr. D. W. Bliss was the Garfield family physician
but the most eminent specialists of the country
were called into consultation. It is the first time within
my memory that I ever heard of the issue of official bulletins
by physicians announcing the condition of their
patients. At the trial of Guiteau he was defended by
his brother-in-law, George M. Scoville, while Judge John
K. Porter of New York and Walter D. Davidge of the
Washington bar were employed to assist in the prosecution.
This trial was of such absorbing interest that men
and women crowded to the City Hall, where admission
was granted only by ticket. No one could possibly have
seen Guiteau without a feeling akin to pity, as he displayed
every indication of possessing an unbalanced mind.</p>

<p>The administration of President Arthur proved a source
of delight to Washington society and afforded abundant
demonstration, as in the cases of Jefferson, Jackson, Van
Buren and Buchanan before him, that a "Mistress of the
White House" in the person of a wife is not an absolute
necessity. Mrs. John E. McElroy, the President's sister,
spent much of her time in Washington and presided with
grace over the social functions of the White House. The
President himself was a gentleman of dignified and imposing
presence and of great social as well as political
tact. He instinctively seemed to know the proper thing
to do and exactly when to do it. I was deeply touched
by his thoughtfulness when my second daughter, Ruth
Monroe, was married in December, 1882. Although we
were still in mourning and had no personal acquaintance
with the President nor other association at that time with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the White House, General Arthur on that occasion sent
superb flowers to my home from the conservatory of the
Executive Mansion. I regarded the act as exceedingly
gracious, but it was in every way characteristic of the
man. The circumstances under which he succeeded to
the Presidential chair were so painful and some of his
former political affiliations were so distasteful to many
that the early portion of his administration was attended
with a certain degree of embarrassment; yet, by sheer
force of character, unquestioned ability and magnificent
tact he so effectively worked his way into the hearts of
the people that he left the Presidential chair as highly
esteemed as any of his predecessors and carried with him
into retirement the applause of the people irrespective of
party affiliation.</p>

<p>I made the acquaintance of General and Mrs. Adolphus
W. Greely soon after his return from his Arctic expedition.
Both he and Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley,
U.S.N., the rescued and the rescuer, were then receiving
the ovations of the public. During our early acquaintance
the Greelys purchased a delightful old-fashioned
house on G Street, below Pennsylvania Avenue, where
they still reside surrounded by a charming group of sons
and daughters. General Greely is always an object of
interest wherever he goes and deservedly so, as scientific
attainments, distinguished bearing and engaging manners
such as his can never fail to win applause. Mrs. Greely,
the bride of his youth and the companion of his maturer
years, wins all hearts and holds them.</p>

<p>It would be both unjust and ungrateful to make no
mention of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, the mother of William R.
Hearst of New York. She came to Washington an entire
stranger as the wife of the late Senator George Hearst of
California, but soon endeared herself to all old residents
by her personal magnetism, her social tact and her phil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>anthropic
acts. Deeply in sympathy with the work
of women, her benevolence in this particular field was
unbounded. Her entertainments were lavish and I was
often numbered among her guests. I especially recall
an evening reception given by her in honor of a company
of authors attending a congress in Washington. It
was remarkable for the number of distinguished men and
women gathered from all parts of the country, some of
whom I had never met before, and among them Mark
Twain, Francis Marion Crawford and William Dean
Howells.</p>

<p>As I lay down my pen, memories of many old friends
are passing before me and of their children, too. Then
there are others with whom I formed ties later in life of
the most enduring character. This is especially true of
my old and cherished neighbors, Rear Admiral and Mrs.
Francis A. Roe. With his work well done he now rests
from his labors, but his widow is yet my valued friend.
Still another is Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley, U.S.
N. who, surrounded by admiring friends in Washington,
lives quietly and unostentatiously and bears his laurels
well; and last, but anything in the world but least, Mrs.
Julian James, a representative of a distinguished New
York family, the daughter of Theodorus Bailey Myers,
who has made her home in Washington for many years,
and is now the "Lady Bountiful" of the National Capital.
Beautiful in person as well as in character, she distributes
her wealth with a lavish hand, and richly deserves the
words "well done."</p>

<p>In looking backward through the years of a long and
active life I have seen varied relays of humanity, all of
them acting their parts and filling their appropriate
niches&mdash;great and small often standing shoulder to
shoulder and engaged in the same strife. Many of them,
my friends in childhood as well as old age, have long
since passed into the life beyond. <i>Vanitas Vanitatis!</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
may be the exclamation of the moralizing cynic, but to
me many of these memories are a blessed heritage, and
I am grateful to the Father of All for permitting me to
catch from them the inspiration to prepare these
rambling notes.</p>

transcontinental/trans-continental; warships/war-ships).</p>
